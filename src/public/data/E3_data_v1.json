One specific idea I'd love to see is a more formal opportunity for employees to take temporary assignments or \"details\" with their own department or another department at the next step up on their career ladder. This is (or was) common in federal government and is a great way to give an individual some experience as a supervisor or team leader while also allowing a department to fill a temporary gap.",

I would recommend an audit of all BU 9 duty statements to determine if a license is actually required to do the job.   I say this because I have seen the state increase the use of \"licensed\" BU 9 staff when a license is not necessary to complete the work. DGS' Division of the State Architect, the Building Standards Commission, and the Office of Sustainability, as well as CalTrans previously hired non-licensed employees to complete the work that Does not  require a license.   However, in the past decade these Departments/Divisions/Commissions have stopped using classifications that do require a license. The problem is that the work required by these entities can be completed by a combination of licensed and unlicensed staff, but by hiring only licensed staff, the state is wasting hundreds-of millions of dollars.   A licensed architect/engineer gets paid (after benefits) $250k/year or more. An unlicensed person doing the work that doesn't require a license gets paid $150k/year. Multiply that $100k/year savings by the thousands of staff at DGS and CalTrans that are paid for their license but don't perform license-level work.  By hiring unlicensed staff to do the unlicensed work, there is also an opportunity for the state to recruit and maintain staff.   But STOP paying licensed BU 9 staff to do work that non-licensed staff can do. It will save the state at least 1/2 a billion dollars.",

We spin our wheels answering GA22s for balance inquiries for hours a day when again, make it available on the tablets. We print monthly court checks for mandatory payments from IP accounts, however each court seems to be entered several times with a slightly different title (ie: Fresno US District vs. Fresno USD) and so multiple checks print out to the same exact place. This is wasteful and time consuming. Correct the duplicate entries so that one check prints per court. Also, SOMS pay sheets mostly print ONE IP per page. This is so wasteful and makes for lots more signing and takes up more room in storage. When asked about at HQ, no one knows how it works so it cannot be fixed. Someone has to know.",

This saves the state money, it often allows for a better quality of living and saved money for the worker and doesn't seem to impinge on productivity as has been shown since working remotely since the pandemic. Those in management would do well to understand a happy workforce is a productive one, and forcing people into working conditions where they have to spend more money to work will not help. You can entice better workers and keep those that are doing well by offering this kind of incentive that so many are doing away with. The primary job of the government should be to serve its people.  Working from home does this, it helps everyone in this State.",

One of the ideas to diversify economic security is a fairer flat tax for all (removing exemptions). This flat taxation idea also helps secures housing and jobs for all thru subsidies offset by the flat tax and creates a liquid cash flow (capital) to help maintain the economy as we shift to more sustainable systems not dependent so much on non-renewable resources with are finite. By broadening the definitions of success we can address phenomenon like corruption, toxicity, hoarding and emphasize values like sharing and improve empathy and caring generally. As we share intelligence and apply it to these common goals people experience and learn from the experience of others so problems that threaten societies are minimized as the cooperation crosses typical socio-economic and other common isolating conditions that threaten an optimal healthy form of democracy and threaten environmental sustainability.  The results are predicted to offer a more sustainable way of life where greater forms of equilibrium and harmony may thrive and the diversity of our intelligence more positively be expressed and celebrated.",

      "content": "One issue I have consistently encountered is the challenge of working with state procured contractors, especially in programs that involve direct public service like case management.  In my experience, onboarding and training contractors can be time consuming, and often their staff do not fully understand program policies or the scope of work. This can lead to inconsistent messaging and confusion for the Californians we serve. Many of these vendors are also based out of state and may not fully grasp the unique needs of our communities.  I believe we should explore bringing more of this work in house. For example, having state employees handle case management could improve consistency, accountability, and transparency. It would also allow us to better control outcomes, reduce excessive billing, and build internal capacity by developing staff skill sets.  While contractors can play a role, I think a more balanced approach with a stronger in-house presence would ultimately lead to better service delivery and public trust.",

In one agency, management prohibited cross-unit dialogue, slowing progress and isolating teams. In another, annual surveys repeatedly flagged communication as the top issue, yet leadership insisted on injecting themselves in every conversation or discouraging communication with other units and divisions. Instead of seeking answers from the sources, managerial direction has focused on the interpretation of resources that often prove incorrect. These decisions negatively impact morale, cause frustrations in a job that would otherwise feel ideal, and reminds of the axom that people don't quit jobs, they quit managers.   Managers often lack subject matter expertise, causing delays and confusion. Many openly promote a â€šÃ„Ãºfake it till you make itâ€šÃ„Ã¹ mindset, prioritizing their own job security over the work required to excel when serving the public. The solution is simple: empower staff to communicate directly and collaborate freely, hire a strong human resources team to handle all of our regular issues, and reduce the layers of management. We can build a more agile, informed, and customer-focused workforce.",

This causes both the management and teams members to stagnate and lose sight of serving the public; eventually many work environments become stressful and toxic.    My idea is to one: give the voice to the team members as this forum does, but allow them to rate their managers or supervisors yearly. Two: measure the amount of turnover on a yearly basis under the tenure of a manager or supervisor. Managers, could be put on yearly training assignments where they can serve in different state organizations. Based on the metrics after 2 or 3 years use the metrics to determine if a manager is effective. If a manager doesn't prove to be effective after this tenure they should be released, re-assigned or demoted. If they are measured to be effective, can they can then be assigned to a permanent position but can be re-evaluated after another 3 years.  This is the basis of my idea. Currently, when a person occupies a managerial seat, there is very little to prevent them from becoming a bottle-neck to progress and there's nothing the team can do about this. I've seen millions of tax payers dollars go to waste because of this scenario. I have seen many managers who are micro-manage out of fear and ignorance and the staff is at their mercy which is a moral killer.  There is no perfect system but we need new direction",

Spreading out the demand for housing outside of the Silicon Valley, Sacramento, and Los Angeles may help decrease the overall prices in those already congested areas.   The state already owns a lot of land. Build work centers (hoteling?) for state employees in different areas where housing is cheaper. Build employee housing at places like Napa State Hospital to attract good candidates and keep them. We have a high turnover and our employees commute from all over.

Project Controls track the money and schedule progress to hold stakeholders accountable.  The current culture is to assume everyone is honest and playing by the rules, so we can hand out the funds and solve problems \"efficiently\" by skipping accountability.  But leaving standard Project Controls out of the process isn't an efficiency; skipping a step in basic project management is a problem.  It is an invitation to some to commit fraud.     This isn't a \"poor performance on the part of some people\" issue.  It is a cultural habit in our institutionalized processes, maybe because we don't have to show profit and loss.  Incorporating the principles of Project Controls in our contract agreements with grantees - mostly invoice format requirements - is a part of the solution.",

In the previous century, everything went through the Office of State Publishing, and the State Library had catalogued copies of everything that was published, but now each agency has its own content management system and publishes to the web with no centralized coordination. Retrieval largely depends on private 3rd party services. Index each web address and tag with metatext; leverage librarians' expertise to structure a retrieval system facilitating public access. Track revision dates, ownership, and language translations within the same platform. Use AI document translation with a common lexicon, have a disclaimer and feedback mechanism to prioritize review (e.g. vital docs), ID bad translations, recommend improvements. Also flag items past a certain revise date. At present we have active standard forms owned by agencies that no longer exist and historic documents posted that pop up when searching for current policy. It is not always clear what is current and what is outdated. Systems like WorldCat and GoogleBooks provide models, and there could also be a concierge function for the public to punch in what they need and receive instructions along with any necessary forms and guidelines (perhaps compiled by AI and verified by human staff, moving to spot checks as effectiveness of the tech is demonstrated).",

In my current employment, I have to track my time, by five minute increments, in one database, I have to add this information to my Outlook calendar, and I have to note it on my timecard. I am hoping there is way all of these databases can be integrated so that we are not spending so much time across multiple platforms to track our time working for the State. I also feel that during the mapping process with the Organizational Improvement Office, OIO, best practices should be shared with all department employees as they are working through their mapping and not at the very end once they have mapped all of the processes for the entire division. This would allow for immediate changes and streamlining to occur, instead of waiting for two years or more for the mapping to be completed before the results are released to the department.

This means developing enough of the tool to see system limitations and get an idea on its overall functionality. This would help develop requirements of the tool as we see shortcomings of what is developed but could also be used as a way to help contractors understand what is being sought out. I would suggest involving program (the internal state teams that would use the tool) early on to ensure the business rules are represented. At the discretion of the State, then we could move to a formal RFP and demo the proof of concept or we could continue development in house.

As a possible solution, the State of California could implement corresponding state-level tax increases to partially backfill federal safety net cuts. Since some of these cuts wonâ€šÃ„Ã´t take effect for a couple of years, there is the possibility that the control of the House and Senate could change in 2026, and then legislation could be passed to undue some of the federal cuts to Medicaid.

Videoconference offerings also help us include Californians with disabilities who may struggle to join us in person due to challenges with transit and accessibility.

One solution Iâ€šÃ„Ã´d like to see is the idea of â€šÃ„Ãºbottleneck detectives.â€šÃ„Ã¹ These would be small cross-functional teamsâ€šÃ„Ã®made up of staff who know the programs inside and outâ€šÃ„Ã®tasked with finding the points where work slows down unnecessarily. Twice a year, they would sit down with their teams, map out processes, and identify steps that donâ€šÃ„Ã´t add value. If a new check or reporting requirement is added, an old one has to be removed. The detectives would track and report back on whatâ€šÃ„Ã´s been eliminated, making sure accountability is preserved without building endless new layers.

Too often, leadership at the state seems to operate from a place of fear rather than support. Leaders seem to focus on blame, micromanagement, and unclear expectations rather than encouragement, collaboration, and clear communication. It feels as though i'm working in my parent's and grandparent's generation. This has created an environment where employees feel disempowered, disconnected, and hesitant to share ideas or challenge the status quo.   To build a more effective and modern workforce, I think California should invest heavily in leadership development and hold leaders accountable for fostering a supportive, transparent, and progressive culture. Leaders should be given the tools to lead the same virtually as they do in-person. Leaders need to be trained to authentically care about their team members, communicate virtually or in-person with kindness and respect, and engage with employees in a way that feels human and positive, rather than robotic and forced. With new generations entering the workforce, leadership needs to adapt to meet evolving workplace expectations. Shifting from a punitive to a supportive leadership model would empower employees to engage fully, collaborate openly, and drive meaningful innovation across state government.",

Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in collaboration and communication between subject matter experts (SMEs) and executive leadership. This disconnect often leads to a reactive environment where teams are constantly putting out fires instead of proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. Solution: Introduce a tiered review system that empowers mid-level managers and SMEs to approve routine documents without requiring executive-level sign-off. This would reduce bottlenecks, increase accountability, and allow leadership to focus on strategic priorities. Implementing digital workflow tools with built-in version control and approval tracking can also enhance transparency and speed. Establish regular cross-functional strategy sessions between SMEs and executives to align on goals, anticipate challenges, and co-create solutions. This would shift the culture from reactive to proactive, encouraging innovation and long-term planning. Additionally, investing in leadership training that emphasizes trust in employee expertise and decision-making can help break down hierarchical barriers and build a more agile, responsive organization.",

They also aren't recognized for it with any pay increase. This creates a very low morale and discourages people to stay within state parks, as they aren't recognized for the work they had to do to keep operations going.

These inefficiencies limit transparency, slow responses to urgent requests, and create inconsistencies across programs.  I proposse Land and Water Use Cloud Pilot aims to address these bottlenecks by demonstrating how a modern, cloud-based data stack can streamline workflows. By automating repetitive tasks, integrating land use and water use analyses, and leveraging scalable platforms such as Google Earth Engine and Snowflake, the pilot will reduce turnaround times, improve collaboration, and ensure results are both accurate and transparent.  This proof-of-concept will show how moving from fragmented, manual systems to an integrated cloud environment can cut processing times dramatically (e.g., reducing ETaw delivery from 12 weeks to 4), while laying the foundation for broader adoption of modern solutions across DWR.

The Department of Insurance (DOI) houses the Fraud Division, a law enforcement unit operating within a regulatory agency. Simultaneously, $80.9 million in annual grant funding is distributed to county District Attorneyâ€šÃ„Ã´s (DA) Offices to prosecute fraud cases. This dual structure presents several challenges: Conflicting Missions: Regulatory agencies prioritize industry oversight and collaboration, which can conflict with the enforcement and prosecutorial roles of law enforcement. Operational Inefficiencies: DOI lacks the infrastructure, procurement agility, and legal support systems typical of dedicated law enforcement agencies. Jurisdictional Gaps: Only counties receiving grants can pursue fraud cases, leaving many areas underserved and creating geographic inequities. Short-Term Incentives: Grant-based funding encourages quick wins over long-term, complex investigations. Ethical Concerns: Financial incentives tied to prosecutions raise questions about the impartiality of justice. Recruitment and Retention Issues: DOI struggles to retain investigators, many of whom leave for better opportunities at the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Proposed Solution The proposal recommends transferring the DOIâ€šÃ„Ã´s Fraud Division (163 peace officers and 75 support staff) and the $80.9 million in grant funding to the California Attorney Generalâ€šÃ„Ã´s Office.",

I think mentorship programs or cross-division shadowing could also be super helpful to give employees real insight into how other parts of state government work.

Sometimes all three departments are involved in permitting a single project, sometimes it is only two of three, or only one. But in the case where all three departments are involved, there are three completely separate and independent processes for submitting the project description and receiving state authorization (not even mentioning the local permitting requirements that are also typically involved). Combined permits may not be possible, but having a single hub for applying for state permits could be a start.

This model already exists in the State Schools, where interpreters are managed effectively by someone with lived professional expertise. Expanding that model across departments would ensure proper support, accountability, and better access for Deaf/Hard of Hearing employees and clients.

By investing in our people like this, we're not just checking HR boxes â€šÃ„Ã¬ we're building a team that's flexible, motivated, and ready to crush whatever challenges come our way. It's time we stop managing and start truly leading.",

The way our duty statements are written and who we prioritize within the hiring process often promotes individuals into leadership roles with very specific (often niche) knowledge, but frequently lacking leadership skills (like compassionate communication, relational intelligence, teambuilding, conflict resolution, creative intelligence, etc). I would suggest two things: Add new AGPA roles (e.g., AGPA 1, AGPA 2, etc) to allow for growth within analyst positions and reduce the need to transition into leadership for monetary purposes. The same is likely true for other position types. And I would also institute better leadership development programs. What we offer now is below minimum standard and/or often suggestive in nature - you \"could\" take X Course, but why do it when you're so busy. I would like to see distinct and explicit development programs, mentorship opportunities, and a clear progression path that tracks which leaders are not only learning these skills but applying them, and then make job opportunities for them to succeed and evolve within their career. I think with better leadership a lot of the bureaucracy, bottlenecking,  communication, and problem-solving issues we face would likely \"get better\" on their own.",

Currently, employees are reviewed by supervisors, but managers rarely receive input from the staff and programs they oversee. This creates a blind spot: how can managers become better leaders, improve efficiency, and address challenges if they never hear from the people most affected by their decisions?  Once someone becomes a manager, the departmentâ€šÃ„Ã´s instinct is often to protect them from criticism. While meant to support leadership, this practice can unintentionally foster waste, fraud, abuse, and inefficiencies. Without meaningful feedback, even well-intentioned managers may not know what needs to change.

This results in a culture of enforcement over empowerment, where employees often feel undervalued and micromanaged rather than inspired to perform at their best.  Suggested solutions:   Implement hiring and promotion practices that prioritize: People skills, Proven ability to develop others, and Desire to lead not just manage. Select supervisors based on leadership potential. The work can be learned on the job but emotional intelligence needs to be there before they become a supervisor and have power over peoples careers.  Build accountability for â€šÃ„Ãºhowâ€šÃ„Ã¹ supervisors lead. Tie supervisor performance evaluations and promotions to: Team morale and retention metrics (if there is a high turn-over then something is wrong that shouldn't be ignored), 360-degree feedback from staff (this is one I have implemented upon myself), and Demonstrated leadership behaviors â€šÃ„Ã® not just output numbers.  Shift the culture from punitive to supportive. Encourage a workplace philosophy that emphasizes: Employee engagement over enforcement Problem-solving conversations instead of automatic discipline, Psychological safety, where staff feel comfortable speaking up.

This forensic review process and account reconciliation would seem to be waste of State resources if the commuter is going to continue to use the same public transportation each month.

Currently, departments solve similar problems other departments are solving or have already solved in isolation, resulting in inefficient and redundant workstreams. The digital service delivery is fragmented and inefficient, also contributing to a confusing and frustrating experience for Californians.   To solve this, I would propose the following:  1. Mandate Inter-departmental Collaboration: The state should create a framework that incentivizes and, where necessary, requires departments and agencies to collaborate on key initiatives. This could involve creating a statewide playbook and process that all digital service projects align and follow with a central oversight.   2. Standardize Technology and Data: We need to break down the technical barriers that prevent departments from working together. A statewide mandate should be put in place to standardize technology platforms and data-sharing protocols. For instance, all digital services should use a common API frameworks and be inter-operable. This would allow different agencies to easily share information, integrate services, and build a more seamless, user-friendly experience for the public.  By implementing these changes, we can move from a system of isolated, inefficient solutions to a collaborative, and cohesive government that is truly focused on better serving the people of California.",

I am sure that the casinos would love to assist paying for it as well since you would be bringing revenue to their casinos with the easy access between LA & Vegas. It is also a lot of desert between the two cities. At least then you would start generating revenue to continue the project. Aside from that I would imagine there would be increased revenue for the city of LA as people from Nevada may want to visit Disney Land, Hollywood, etc. with easier access.

Politicians pushing their objectives and the people making the rules and regulations have either never done the work or haven't done it in so long they do not understand the impact of the policies and procedures, or whether it will make sense to the end user applying the rule. Which also impacts having qualified training (or lack thereof). State training is normally developed and administered by people who are far removed from having done the work. Maybe there should be more in person, role-based training with SME's to assist. Maybe if each department had 1 non-management person (kind of like a SB/DVBE advocate) from each department/agency be a procurement representative to present department issues at a bimonthly forum (like SCAN).   There should procurement meetings for the department/agency representatives where new laws that have been enacted can be reviewed to ensure understanding where they can have a voice to speak about how those are impacting their jobs, etc.",

I also find that the electronic platforms do not offer the opportunity for networking, which is so valuable as you move on in your career.  I also find a lot of these trainings are being cut too short.  My employees don't feel like they are being given the opportunity to really retain the information, which only sets them up for failure.  I am a \"hands-on\" learner myself, and so when my new hires tell me that they would have liked to physically handle some of the example processes, instead of virtually working through them, I can completely empathize with that.  New hires are going out into their offices and causing even more exhaustion and congestion amongst those that already know the job and are trying to slow down enough to help the new hires catch up.  I find that there is much more \"on-the-job\" training needed, but we are already so stressed for workers that this causes a major inconvenience for the office to have to pick up the slack where the training is lacking.

Instead of routing documents for signatures, we can use interactive online forms to collect structured data and automate approvals. Online forms are faster to set up, reusable, and mobile-friendly. They also ensure accuracy by requiring fields, validating entries, and feeding submissions directly into tabular formats like Excel or SharePoint Lists. This eliminates manual transcription, reduces errors, and cuts down on repetitive administrative work.  The benefits are clear:  - Saves time by reducing steps (no printing, scanning, or configuring signatures)  - Improves efficiency with real-time submission tracking and notifications  - Avoids waste by reducing paper use and redundant tasks  - Supports accessibility by providing legible, mobile-friendly entry options for both office and field staff  This small change could save staff and the general public hours each week and provide cleaner, more usable data for decision-making â€šÃ„Ã® aligning with Executive Order N-30-25â€šÃ„Ã´s call for operational efficiencies across state government.",

It's far less expensive to catch someone up than to pay for all of the services they will need once they are homeless. 2nd - once someone becomes homeless, we need the ability to get them into mid - term (1-2 year) housing with wrap around services to ensure they can have their physical/mental health needs addressed, get or increase their employment, find childcare if necessary, and save money. During this time, they should also have access to financial literacy education, job training, and if needed, drug treatment programs.

Embracing telework in this way opens up state jobs to many more Californians all across the state rather than just people that live in a couple metro areas, it would reduce carbon emissions and traffic, as well as lower the cost of road maintenance in those areas, as well as be a huge benefit to the all employees. The FTB campus also has lightrail access, as well as a free parking lot, which would be a cost savings to employees who currently work downtown and have to pay for parking. the money saved from things like this could be used to help departments balance their budget and we would be able to better fund things that actually benefit residents of the state.  I know this is an incredibly lofty idea, and would require a lot of planning, but I think it could provide a great deal of savings, and would make jobs with the state more appealing to most people. if we as a state are committed at being the best, we need to embrace forward thinking tactics, not stick to \"what we always have done\"",

If we can improve retention and staffing, it will go a long way to accelerating timelines and improving efficiency.",

This impacts morale, slows progress, and weakens the overall effectiveness of the team.  To address this, Iâ€šÃ„Ã´d advocate for a more meaningful and transparent performance evaluation process that includes peer feedback and self-assessments, not just supervisor input. Raises and promotions should reflect both tenure and performance, so that strong employees feel valued and motivated. Iâ€šÃ„Ã´d also propose a peer recognition program to highlight those who go above and beyond, and development plans for employees who need improvement. Finally, training supervisors to actively manage performance issues would help ensure accountability.  These changes would support a healthier workplace culture and better public service.

For those who have been over-achievers all of our lives, to have a mediocre manager provide this is frustrating and off-putting. Encourage managers to work hard on these as this engagement will motivate staff, support professional growth and ensure that high performers feel valued. Less effective managers tend to provide only average or generic reviews, even for excellent employees, without offering guidance on how they can advance. This lack of feedback discourages staff and can hinder development. Additionally, promotions should be based on demonstrated leadership qualities rather than circumstance. A stronger vetting process is needed to ensure promotions go to those who consistently model dedication and performance. HR should also allow and encourage higher rankings for employees who truly give 110%. When staff exceed expectations but their reviews do not accurately reflect their effort, it creates deep frustration and drives talented employees to consider leaving for agencies where their contributions will be recognized.

Proper education in evolving with technology and developing less complicated means to accomplish required tasks enables big changes to be handled in a more incremental manner, which, in turn, allows more adequate training and mitigates the inherent aversion to change by offering what appears more like help, rather than a potentially overwhelming or burdensome addition/change to one's workload or processes.  This ultimately improves job satisfaction, thus improving morale and even reducing costs as work completion times not only reduce, but the ease and desire for employees to complete more work increases.

In most cases when the employee's doctor is recommending telework as a reasonable accommodation, departments will do anything to delay or deny telework as a reasonable accommodation. Departments have continually been allowed to ignore and violate the ADA, EEOC, and FEHA policies and regulations and oppose doctor's recommendations for appropriate reasonable accommodations.   As a whole, the state needs to hold departments accountable for following appropriate policies and regulations pertaining to reasonable accommodations. More timely processes and procedures should be implemented. It is unreasonable to allow each department's EEO unit/section 90 days to investigate themselves, while not providing an employee with a disability their recommended reasonable accommodations.

So the state ends up buying new and from a business that is charging a premium for simply drop shipping from major retailers only because they are willing to fill out the paperwork.  We should be spending money on quality equipment at a reasonable price. But all the red tape to purchase cost 2x as much for the same item that can be purchased with a credit card.

Furthermore, this system fosters a dense layer of middle management that often controls decisions without fully understanding their upstream or downstream impacts. This disconnect between decision-makers and practitioners undermines efficiency and responsiveness.  To truly improve government operations, this overarching management structure must be reformed.

Some corporations illegally or inappropriately received PPP loans based on the honor system and took PPP loan deductions in their returns.  If the FTB shared this misrepresentation found during routine audits with other agencies such as SBA to enforce those (i.e. large and publicly traded corporations) that inappropriately received funds, the State of CA would be able revive the income.  When CA funds are inappropriately used to fund profitable corporations during the panddemic such as PPP loans and online criminals continuously stealing money from the State of CA's IT systems, more law enforcement is needed to avoid the illegal loss of funds .  Rather than cutting state salaries, budget cuts, and other reductions that harm the State of CA and our taxpayers, we should pursue the large corporations and criminals that illegally received the funds in the first place.  Placing more security on our IT systems is crucial for protecting our taxpayer funds from continual hacking and misappropriation of funds.  Instead of hitting the CA taxpayers with more costs and illegal use of taxapyer funds, the politicians should invest more in our IT crime prevention to protect the State of CA & its people.",

There are so many steps to complete the most minute tasks, and those tasks seem to be complicated because leadership makes it complicated.  The strict hierarchical approach - at lease from my experience - has just created fear and insecurity about performing daily work.  There isn't an open forum to freely share ideas or talk about new ways of doing things.  We are relegated to a desk manual that is incomplete and doesn't actually allow anyone to think creatively.  I have been assured that every department is not like this, but I have also been told that I work in one of the best departments - so does that mean it's worse out there??  I would LOVE to see more flexibility, mentoring from leaders, allowing for mistakes, and basic access to leaders so we can ask how they got to where they are in the organization.  We look to our leaders for support and guidance.  When they only effort they make is to remind us about our timecards, that's not actually leadership.",

Other BDOs operate similar types of databases.   The state should strongly consider a system to compare the applicable numeric values in the self-reports against the regulatory thresholds.

Many police agencies have adjusted to the times and now allow officers to wear well groomed beards and display tattoos that are of good taste and not objectively offensive.  However, the California Highway Patrol has not allowed tattoos to be displayed nor male officers to have beards, all for the sake of tradition.  Our modern culture has grown to accept both as acceptable in the workplace, and in fact, makes officers more relatable.  Many communities may be able to relate to an officer who has tattoos, especially younger people.  As the melting pot of the United States, many foreign cultures co-exist in California and universally respect male officers with beards as being elders with serious life, and job experience, particularly when they see gray in the beard.  This makes them more willing to listen and being compliant with an officer.  It's already permitted for religious exemptions, i.e. for Sikh officers.  It should be permitted across the board for all officers.  This may seem like a non-issue to someone not in law enforcement, but other agencies have noticed higher levels of recruiting and retention by allowing tattoos and beards.  It is also a huge morale booster and allows officers to express themselves as individuals and humans, rather than as de-humanized, monotonous, faceless agents of the government.

To solve this I would prioritize modernization of internal systems by moving toward cloud -based, user friendly platforms that allow for real-time updates, digital signatures, and mobile access and also provide adequate training especially for LEADERSHIP! Another major issue is how state departments communicate to the public.  Too often, forms, notices, websites, and presentations are written in dense bureaucratic language that can be confusing.  I would recommend shifting toward PLAIN LANGUAGE communication across all state agencies, making information clear, simple and accessible to all Californians.  Alongside this, we should invest in practical resources like website tutorials, FAQs, or short instructional YouTube videos, that guide people step by step filling out forms and accessing services or joining public online meetings.",

In most cases, departments are unable to fill vacancies until after the position becomes vacant. This leads to an exodus of knowledge and expertise from the department that is not easily replaced as it often takes years for an individual to become fully proficient in their role, establish connections with others and gain career long learning. While this practice may lead to salary savings, it creates a knowledge deficit which then leads to efficiency loss until such time as the individual staff person learns the position and becomes proficieint and beyond. If departments had the ability to hire replacement staff while the existing staff person was still present, the knowledge transfer would be more streamlined, and the institutional knowledge can be much more easily passed on to the new staff member. An in-between step might involve the creation of desk manuals for new staff to access however these will not necessarily impart the same level knowledge as the in person tutelage of the out-going staff member.",

Perhaps they had attached transcripts there that could save 10 days to get here.                Another issue I'd like to address is the use of different documents across state entities. Many processes, policies and procedures begin with guidance from CalHR and the State Personnel Board (SPB) but each department then adapts that guidance using its own forms or supporting docs. This results in inconsistencies across departments. Establishing a standardized process that starts with CalHR and SPB guidance and carries forward uniformly would promote consistency, fairness, and equity across CA.",

I believe we can do better in promoting accountability and recognizing the contributions of those who genuinely contribute to the team's success in order to have a more positive work environment.

At the same time, we are told that we need to provide the same, if not higher level of service to the public.

The situation just feels like a crash happening in slow motion with me as a rank-and-file watching it happen with little that I can do about it.  If I had a magic wand that could easily change things, I would focus on ramping up hiring and retention. I understand there are budgetary considerations, but it is not possible to recruit and retain long term employees if our district Does not  have any growth opportunities for seasonal staffing. An overreliance on seasonal employees seems to be the crutch that my department relies on, forcing interested seasonals to endure years of attrition and competition before landing a permanent position.  By retaining more long term employees, they will have a better chance of learning how state systems work and managing them efficiently and effectively.

One of the reasons this happens if SPB has a rule that examination results are kept private, so there is no way to know the exam results of others who have taken the same exam, and it becomes extremely difficult to prove when others rig and/or cheat the system.  Another reason is the heavy reliance on job references, which seem to these days be more important than actual work experience and meeting job qualifications.

This has been caused by at least 2 different things: 1) RTO policies and refusing to listen to state employees; 2) poor management and bad leadership that results in inefficient or unfair division of labor. Leadership, starting at the very top, needs to respect and listen to state workers. When policies, like RTO, are implemented without any real consideration of how it will upend the lives of civil servants--that is disrespectful and will always lead to low morale. I have also seen morale be impacted by poor leadership and bad supervisors (i.e. ones that do not listen to their employees and refuse to pivot when needed, or just flat out assign work unfairly). Once morale is low, people will begin doing the \"bare minimum.\"  They will take very little pride in their work. They will not care about outcomes. They will be so stressed and they will lose their focus at work. This is what leads to inefficiency. When you have workers who are able to pay their bills comfortably (because they are receiving a fair wage), when they see management take on the hard tasks (because management is making more money and should be taking on the more challenging projects), when they are allowed to work in places of safety and comfort (such as their own homes where they are mostly shielded from inappropriate conduct such as workplace violence, racist or sexist comments, physical-micro-management, etc.), that is what will improve efficiency for all!!",

We transitioned to a paperless file system  back in 2006 when the State began requiring reports/data to be submitted and uploaded to the Geotracker database. There are still 100s of existing folders, reports, etc. (one estimate was that our unit's file room contains 1/3 of a mile of paper). Environmental pollution cases are unique: we're required to keep records of all sites, closed or not, in case land use changes in the future (also, it's the law). We routinely have PRA/FOIA requests to pull files for consultant review, and more than 75% of the time they'll ask us to scan and email them.  Our region is also vast- some of these consultants and landowners live 6 hours away from out office, and some have physical handicaps that limit their mobility, so we try to oblige. But actually taking apart a file, scanning it, categorizing it, and uploading it is extremely labor intensive. A small file will take a few hours, but even a medium sized one requires one or two days (the scanning is rapid, uploading and naming is laborious).  SOLUTIONS: 1) hire dedicated admin staff to do this work, 2) subcontract it out to a bonded document scanning service. BENEFITS: 1) Reduced labor costs for professional and admin staff 2) improved public access for these records 3) potential to upload to AI for detailed summation and analysis. Thank you,",

My solution to this problem would be for the California Department of Technology restart it's program to create a state cloud. The technology to do so has come a long way since it's last attempt and there is opportunity to recruit recently laid off tech workers into the civil service to support such a project as well as opportunities for more smaller local technology companies to engage in contract work to support the open-source software that will underpin it all.

This could make software more accessible and affordable, encourage development of the state IT workforce, reduce reliance on private sector contracts, and create a more universal user experience, reducing the need for training when someone changes agencies.

Their university has to negotiate a legal agreement (a MOU) with the agency, often involving lawyers on both sides. This process can take months and discourages students and agencies from even trying.  My proposal: The Department of General Services (DGS) should create a blanket MOU that covers academic internships between all California public college systems (Community Colleges, CSU, and UC) and all state agencies. This would eliminate the need for each university and agency to negotiate separate legal agreements every time a student wants to intern.  Agencies would still define the details of each internshipâ€šÃ„Ã®like duties, schedules, and supervisionâ€šÃ„Ã®but the legal framework would already be in place.  This would: - Make it easier for students to gain hands-on experience in public service. - Reduce administrative burden for both colleges and agencies. - Create a clear recruitment pathway for state agencies to identify and develop future talent. - Expose students to careers in public service, helping build a stronger, more diverse pipeline into government work.",

Californians want government to have easy to use online tools, one-stop-shop permits, data access portals, and to use the latest technology to make people's lives better. Both IT and non-IT contracts are cumbersome and require navigating gate keepers who do not understand agency needs. If a project is deemed IT by contracting personnel, my agency will simply not move forward. If a contract gets flagged for the PAL process with CDT, the contract is dead, and we will never resubmit. Money lasts 3 years, and the PAL process can take that long, leaving no time for the money to be used on the intended project. Further, getting non-IT contracts through DGS is time-consuming and cumbersome with little added value, decreasing the time for the money to actually do work.   My suggestion would be to loosen up contract oversight on the frontend, actually provide training to staff, and provide more resources for auditing and enforcement of contract rules and ethics on the backend. In this way, SME staff will be trained on contract creation and execution (which is currently not the case) and can quickly get money out in flexible ways, taking advantage of as much of the 3 year money lifetime as possible, while knowing that they must strictly adhere to contract rules or their money will get pulled back and contracts will get cancelled.

Help them to come out permanently and join mainstream.  Right now, I serve as board member for HART of Folsom, and we are proud to have reduced Folsom's homelessness by 10% this way. 3rd, go deeper and help people that are homeless longer and probably will never come out.  Build shelters with services for them and make rules to humanely require them to take those services. Those rules might curtail some of their freedom, but they should know that it's cost to pay for not being able to come out of homelessness by themselves.   Finally, to do all this work, encourage and fund the non-profits directly from the state so that the rules are uniform. One positive side effect is that more non-profit jobs are created this way. Each city and county having its own rules and managing and distributing funds will only create more red tape and confusion and dysfunction.

To solve this problem, I think we should ensure that employees and supervisors are being periodically checked in on. I have had three roles within the state government since 2021 and have never had a performance review or worked with a supervisor on a plan for trainings or moving forward in my career.

Having a one size fits all telework model is also bad for retaining talent. We need technically proficient staff. If talented staff can telework full time with better work life balance and greater physical and mental health, and be treated with respect in managing their workload in the private sector, why would they opt to work for the state where we are treated like we can't be trusted to manage ourselves or allowed to telework based on operational need?

Proposed Idea Create a safe, department-wide collaboration channel where auditors can directly share and discuss regulation questions with a large group of experienced peers. For example, an internal email group or moderated forum could allow auditors to submit questions and receive input quickly, without having to navigate multiple levels of approval.

      "content": "I have been with the State for just over a year, after working in the private sector for most of my life (with a couple of temp government jobs here and there). The biggest issue that I noticed from day one is the amount of bureaucracy that envelops almost every aspect of how the State operates. I pretty much knew that going in, but when I actually experienced it I was kind of shocked. Everything is just so difficult! I'm used to having ownership of my role and various tasks and getting things handled quickly - not having to go through 15 people for something or having to wait 8 months for a PO and then supervisor approval and to only order something from one specific place, for example. Also, I get a lot of emails and phone calls from the public and it can be incredibly difficult trying to determine who to forward to. I often go to our website and sit there scrolling through trying to find the info myself, with much difficulty.   Oh and the way people make payments online - the entire system needs to be overhauled. All of the phone calls I receive are either about duplicate payments on their credit card, or they couldn't log in to their account to make their payment. I then have to take down all their info and email my contacts to ask them to help. Takes a lot of time!  As one of my co-workers said when I first started: \"It's about accountability, not efficiency!\"",
