     "The Palisades should not be denser without a well developed effective evacuation plan for future fires.",
     "In certain neighborhoods this makes a lot of sense.",
     "I have tried to work with her building and planning department to rebuild our house and was under the impression they would assist us with fewer road blocks in our efforts. But personally I haven't seen the type of service the government keeps talking about in terms of helping. I've seen the same problems working with the building and planning department as pre fire.  I would welcome that type of assistance in my attempts to rebuild our house. I have an approved permit from the building department to turn our power back on and the Edison company still refuses to turn on the power.",
     "I don\u2019t think new densely packed houses makes for a good neighborhood thing. Fires spread to quickly easily. Plus new neighborhood residents like elbow room.",
     "We barely made it out alive during the last fire with many abandoning cars and fleeing on foot. The Palisades does not need higher density.",
     "Unfortunately, \"density\" sometimes translates to developers building multi-unit housing where only a few units are rented because they can afford to leave the others vacant. I also agree with the comments about how this is better utilized in areas that are multi-use near transit corridors and business centers. I don't think this is the right move for the Palisades.",
     "We are in a SEVERE HIGH FIRE ZONE!! This would be so unsafe as it was extremely traumatic to evacuate on January 7th. Adding more density would be a HUGE MISTAKE. Please  speed up the permit process for those that need to build.",
     "I am not sure it makes sense to increase population density on the WUI, but I am always in favor of increasing development on infill. It may make sense for there to be a buyback campaign on the side of the state for the most impacted areas so that they can be maintained as natural firebreaks. Encouraging development in fire safer areas, ie in greater LA around transit, makes sense",
     "expedite building, yes. Higher density absolutely not. It's dense enough!",
     "Absolutely opposed to adding density in the Very High Fire Hazard Zone. It was enough of a traffic jam to evacuate. There is no public transit in the Palisades save for one measly bus route. Encourage high density proximate to the Metro, DTLA and places with good public transit.",
     "Yes we need this across LA. We can\u2019t just keep up the sprawl. And not everyone wants to live in a single family home,",
     "Please see pre house comme ts about government lack of support for multifamily homeowners after the fires. Also, we had major congestion problems with homeowners fleeing the Palisades during the fires. Greater population density only makes the problem greater",
     "I don't want more condensed housing in the Palisades but I do want building permits sped up.",
     "Is it all just going to get snapped-up by investors and possibly just sit empty or used as air bnb's?  You'd need to change more than just the building permit process.",
     "Good way to help build more dense housing within reason. As bad as it sounds its a clean slate, so why not use this opportunity to increase the housing stock",
     "I need more specific details",
     "Can we be thoughtful about high-fire prone areas?  Should we even re-build at all in every area?",
     "Pros: density may increase business and vibrancy\ncons: Unmanaged market development will not provide community improvements (micro parks, 3rd spaces, walkability, beautification. Profit could become the prime motivator. the market could build cheap and quick, and not necessarily up to code. Also high density increases future fire risk with reduced defensible space.",
     "This issue needs to be broken out to be answered.  Increasing density (controversial) is a complete separate issue from expediting building permits (universally favored).  Additionally, the goal referenced can obviously be accomplished through a wide variety of other initiatives as well.",
     "Okay if \"smart design\" is used ... denser areas combined with open space. The net result should not increase citywide population beyond current planning/zoning.\n\nChanging the zoning and letting the \"market manage\" would require zoning for beautiful parks and/or  landscaped public paths nearby",
     "Increase density is not the solution for increasing affordable housing.  Maybe increase efficient public transportation.",
     "More housing and denser living is not what the Palisades needs.",
     "This question fails to address the need for long term planning.  A specific plan must be developed which looks at existing infrastructure (sewer, water, electrical, emergency services, equity in housing supply) before any changes to zoning.  How can you shoehorn in more density without studying impact on natural resources, traffic and wildfire exposure?",
     "We are lucky there weren't more deaths and injuries in these fires. Denser populations is the wrong direction.",
     "I support efforts to speed up building permits for homeowners who want to rebuild and return to their homes and community. However, I do not support increasing density in fire-affected areas like Altadena. This is not the time to use our community as a solution to broader housing shortages. Our focus should be on helping displaced residents return\u2014not opening the door to large-scale development that could change the character of the neighborhood. The growing presence of outside developers proposing housing for populations not originally rooted here is a reflection of this shift, and it raises real concerns about long-term community impact.",
     "This is again Government getting in the way of what was one of the gems of SoCal.  Now, it seems you want to build cheap housing complexes where once beautiful ocean view homes once stood.  It is outrageous.",
     "I generally agree, but this is oddly worded. What do you mean by denser? Allowing apartment buildings where there were SFRs? What do you mean by \"allow the market to manage construction\" The overall goal I strongly agree with. Speeding up permits I strongly agree with. And I urge letting rebuilders, their teams and a supportive, streamlined, well staffed,  permitting department speed up the process - as was done for Coffee Park after Tubbs Fire, e.g.",
     "Again, population density with regard to existing infrastructuer/traffic/and ability to evacuate from fire risk areas is critical to this being a workable solution.",
     "We do need to find solutions to address housing shortages and there could be an equitable opportunity here, but depends how it comes together.",
     "Let the market decide with permitting, tariffs, labor shortages and inflation and you will be inviting the poorer and middle class residents of Altadena to leave in hurry, selling their land to large developers who have no stake in the community to build quick and flee. They will make (as usual) overpriced units which will be bought by the wealthy and re-rented at elevated and unaffordable rates while destroying the feel of the area and making it less safe for fire while straining already strained community resources. Altadena is TOO dense already. The new fire maps will not require sufficient fire hardening to meet all but the most basic requirements which are not enough for the kind of fire which caused all this in the first place. NO.",
     "These are different issues and a poorly worded question. Permits should be free and expidited.",
     "These should be separate questions. 100% yes to speeding up building permits, and using AI to streamline. The question of density is a separate one. We need more density in urban hubs closer to public transportation and businesses. Altadena should not be rebuilt denser, other than the existing ADU rules, which will already double the density. That is more than sufficient. The community is not an urban hub and should not have higher-rise housing. It is an exurban foothill community.",
     "This is a sweeping measure with vague language.",
     "I take issue with the way this option is stated. To me this seems to be combining two/three different issues. To me speeding up building permits is vital. The issue of accommodating denser populations needs to be addressed separately. And \"allow the market to manage construction\"? IMO this question is based on some questionable assumptions, is politically phrased and needs to be recast.",
     "of course",
     "We should not be conflating fast permits with increased density.  We do not need increased density in fire areas.",
     "This is combining two distinct issues. Expedited permits are indeed appreciated, but greater density is the opposite of what fire-damaged areas need! If anything, having greater separation and fire-retardant structures/landscaping might have helped mitigate the disaster. This seems like a disguised land-grab proposal when people are at their most vulnerable.",
     "Support speeding up permits but unsure on the density requirements. These shouldn\u2019t be lumped together.",
     "This is a great idea! My concern is that the streets of the Palisades were jam packed due to overcrowding. I believe that if this is to occur, that no parking should be allowed on the streets.",
     "Denser population accommodation is a unrelated issue to building permit speed. Many rebuilders would personally benefit/recover from faster permits, but faster permits just mean more profits and unsafer building if it is a developer.",
     "These are two separate issues. Red tape should be cut and follow thru on the speeding up of permits for home owners.\nWe do not need denser population we are not looking to change the landscape of our community and the last thing we need to do is further bottleneck escape routes in case of emergency.",
     "The permits should be expedited and the government should have a way to streamline construction - the trucks going through neighborhoods and communities will need to be coordinated.",
     "Expediting permits should be for pre-existing owners of SFR and multi-family properties to provide rebuilding for those owners and renters affected by the fires- not new tenants.  Increased housing density beyond what already was in place in the Palisades is a NO.",
     "This should only be in areas that are already zoned for multifamily/mixed use. Agreed with other comments that impacts on existing infrastructure and resources + evacuation planning must be considered.",
     "These are separate issues. \n\ni do not believe in denser neighborhoods.\n\ni do believe permits need to be issued to rebuild faster so people can go home.",
     "This appears to be a land grab and reinvention of the area. Families don\u2019t want this",
     "Adding more population to an area that has already been affected and could potentially be affected by another fire in the future given high winds is not wise.",
     "I'm not in favor of increased density\u2014it would fundamentally change one of the key reasons many of us chose to live in Altadena.",
     "ADUs would be an option I would support but not big multi unit buildings",
     "Dude, we almost died. Let's please solve \"housing shortages caused by fires\" by focusing on helping the actual disaster victims with these fire recovery initiatives. Not making the evacuation lines even longer.",
     "Where else are our low income neighbors going to live? Cardboard boxes?",
     "Very supportive of increased housing density. Expedited permits should not come at the cost of environmental review.",
     "Communities and free market should manage their property choices.",
     "Somewhat opposed because speed generally means bypassing environmental rules and others that are deemed lower priority. I see the need, but I think this needs to be done in a way that still upholds strict environmental standards that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
     "we cant answer questions without further info on how to implement this practically for existing survivors, not new developers scooping up land...",
     "I have real concerns over this -- you're talking about introducing numerous multi-unit housing structures in a predominately (historically) residential/single-family community. Part of what drew many of my friends to Altadena was the fact that it was a community full of family-occupied houses with yards in a walkable area. My experience in Pasadena has been more apartments/condos mean more traffic -- heavier parking loads, heavier commuting on the streets. I think the residents of Altadena should really have a say on how many of these multi-unit properties might be built.",
     "No! OMG - NO! Our infrastructure is already on its knees unable to accommodate our existing population. Our evacuation pathways left us literally in counseling for PTSD because we were stuck in gridlocked traffic surrounded by flames with our tires catching on fire or melting. It took HOURS to get out to safety. And this was exactly the same thing that happened 47 years ago when I evacuated in the Mandeville fire. NOTHING has been done to help us be safe since then. We live in a high fire danger location as was evidenced just 6 months ago. What in the world are we talking about increased density housing for? We don\u2019t have enough street space to be safe in an emergency. No water, inadequate fire, police, electricity, sewer. No more people!!!",
     "I appreciated that these communities were largely home-owners. It's fine if you want to address more density but not via commercial real estate companies buying up properties and creating high rent prices.",
     "Yes. Increased density should be planned near major corridors and walking distance to commercial areas.",
     "I don't want high rise apartments but if homes can be built up to accomodate more people like ADUs and joint living spaces, that could work and still keep the small community feel of Altadena.",
     "This needs to be about local residents not big companies and developers. \n\nAnd when I say residents I don't mean those with the biggest houses and most money. \n\nApartments aren't just temporary living situations, they're homes too. \"Low income\" housing being $2000/month for 350 sq ft is laughable, by the way. Rebuilding high density doesn't mean cram shoeboxes together.\n\nIf it is not a true primary residence or if its owned by a corporation it should not be prioritized for rebuild.",
     "Focus should be on rebuilding homes for existing Palisades residents",
     "Increasing population density in a fire zone makes no sense.",
     "This is TWO different questions.  (1) Allow construction to accommodate denser populations in fire-affected areas. Answer NO.   Allow fewer buildings in fire prone areas.  (2) The goal is to make new housing available and address housing shortages caused by the fires.\nAnswer:  NO.  This:  The goal is to make new LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME housing more available and address LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME housing shortages DUE TO ALL CAUSES.",
     "Prioritize what the residents want, not the developers, not the lobbyists or outside influence.",
     "yes, but these communities should have excellent resilience planning, not just more dense, crappy houses that will burn down again. the resilience plans should be deep and address short, medium and long term risks, not just fire, so the communities come out strong, better, more stable and more safe (which will make them more valuable, too)",
     "Destroyed communities need to be allowed to rebuild in the same character and charm they once had, so long as that is what the residents desire. Multi-unit housing, cramming more units onto lots, etc. only caters to corporate builders and those looking to maximize profits over aesthetics and appropriateness for the area.",
     "Aren't these two distinct issues? Yes please speed up permitting. No, it should not be denser.",
     "ADUs are OK. Mukltifamily in R-1 zones are not OK.",
     "Can't believe you are putting these 2 totally unrelated points together.",
     "So far the city of LA and the county have not been able to build affordable housing for less than $800,000 a unit and those units are 500 ft.\u00b2 on average. We\u2019re talking about over $1000 a foot. That\u2019s luxury housing. This is an unsustainable solution. There are much better options to generate affordable housing than this.",
     "Palisades is dense enough as is. More would be dangerous.",
     "\"The Market\" got us into this mess in the first place. We need government to be the responsible party to protect everyone from building in locations that are fireprone.",
     "LA\u2019s housing crisis will never improve unless we build more and build up. It doesn\u2019t have to be everywhere but it needs to be somewhere people want to live (ie not downtown). Everyone loves a yard and a view, but I think we can all agree housing all Angelenos is more important right now.",
     "I am concerned abt increased housing density",
     "It took us 2.5 hours to go 5 miles with a fire tearing through our neighborhood. The last thing we need is increased density - this would only result in more lives at risk!",
     "This sounds like something the corporations buying up land in Altadena would be a big fan of, but I am not.",
     "Two different questions.\nYes to speeding up building permits but not at the expense of lowering building standards.\nNo to changing neighborhoods into high density housing that changes the whole tenor of the neighborhood.",
     "Sensible denser housing would be great. Many of these affected areas are high desirable. Denser housing will allow more to enjoy and more value (sigh taxes!) to be unlocked",
     "This is a bad idea for many reasons and fire prevention is an obvious one.",
     "You want to pack even more people into areas that are prone to fire??? Any \u201cstreamlining\u201d of the permit process must stipulate the creation and maintenance of efficient evacuation routes for whatever the population density is.",
     "This was a semi-rural equestrian community with poor public transport options. Increased density will change the community, and the transit system or our rural sidewalk-lacking roads aren't ready for density.",
     "Why build back denser? This doesn't make sense. Build back for the community that lost their homes, so they can move back.",
     "Opposed for two reasons:\n1) Too high of a density can utterly destroy a town's history, character, safety, and over burden infrastructure, utilities, roads, small businesses, and the environment.\n2) Wealthier areas will get a pass and middle- and lower-income areas will be innundated with new structures. We have already seen this with exemptions for Palisades and east Altadena, while the older and more historic west Altadena has gotten no such consideration.",
     "I don't like the idea of a \"denser\" community, it should build back what was there. If homeowners decide to build an ADU or other options they should have that right but denser suggests something completely different to me.",
     "These are two separate matters that should not be conflated. Density increases would change the community in ways not bargained for when Altadena homes were purchased prefire. Many of us moved to Altadena to escape higher Density and chose fresh air, unclogged streets, quiet. Speeding up permits should happen, but not at the cost of QC. Allowing the market to manage construction will lead to higher prices, lower quality.",
     "Housing shortage was not caused by the fire, it was already a problem.",
     "Supportive as long as that's for structures with 20 or so units or less. More affordable housing, while keeping the character",
     "NOT if this means 'streamlining' or 'ministirial approvals' or getting rid of CEQA where the public will have no knowledge of what was approved behind the City Hall desk.  NO to the market. Yes to some kind of regulation.",
     "Again, I can't over emphasize how important is parking is to community development. If adequate parking can be provided with multi- unit construction, then it might work. If not, forget it.",
     "Allow construction that does not include density to be speeded up so that people who lost their homes can rebuild & return to their homes.",
     "Stop trying to force low income housing down everyone's throat. We all thought this is what you would do and look this is what the state is doing. Taking advantage of the people who had their life ruined to push for low income housing",
     "No, there needs to be a plan that is regulated and overseen by some authority that ensures good construction and preserves prior neighborhood composition.  Unbridled, market driven construction, ripe for corruption, would not do that.",
     "I'm not convinced unleashing the market is the best way. It isn't super profitable to make affordable homes for regular people. Developers know they can maximize profit by building large rentals and McMansions. Unleashing the market means we get more of these. I think strong central planning can still be fast if it's crafted carefully. Craft the central planning carefully and release the power of the government.",
     "Increased density in fire-affected areas requires adequate evacuation routes. No additional density should be permitted in the Palisades where there are only 4 evacuation routes, 3 of which put you on PCH.",
     "Sorry, not a fan. Single family home owners need permits just as quick (quicker) than the state's plans for Multi Unit, high density projects of CA State Senator Scott Weiner.\nPlease allow Altadena to build back in the style and zoning that we've had for generations. We really don't have the best infrastructure to handle high density.",
     "That is not a long term solution which this requires.  You drive housing on market decisions which ultimately lead to overdevelopment, environmental impact and unaffordable units.",
     "The goal should be to rebuild and get people back into their homes. worry about density later and get permits issued!!!!!!!",
     "I think regarding building back Altadena and PP, keeping the prior single-family unit home structure and prior 'feel' of those suburban communities is preferable. You don't need denser units/populations in areas surrounded by fire-prone vegetation - especially since the transportation and aquatic infrastructure is not able to accommodate such a population.",
     "Please focus on housing the homeless which has to date proven to be a something that the government has not been able to do effectively.  We don\u2019t need them now to take this one.",
     "Complete waste of money.",
     "What is the size of the displacement? Will this come out of somebody's ALE?",
     "I'm dubious. Instead, why not help people cut through the bureaucracy. Arrange access to expert advice and services. Architects, engineers, contractors that have been vetted. Use collective bargaining to secure raw materials at good rates: copper, concrete, rebar, lumber, pipe, insulation, soil for infill and landscaping etc...Also, why not create a volunteer service where people can offer homeowners help to rebuild if they have the time and skills and if not, make it a training program. Teach some of these kids going into college a trade so that they have something to fall back on when AI takes the career that they haven't started yet and the bulk of the current construction laborers have been deported.",
     "Doesn't seem necessary.  Six months later, most people have figured out temp housing but barriers & delays to get them back into their pre fire homes need to be removed",
     "I think this feels like a waste of time and resources when so many homes need to be rebuilt -- it feels much more reasonable to join existing programs like EmergencyRV for folks who want that type of solution or to pursue the ADU solution so that homeowners are putting up a structure that should provide added value to their homes in future years.",
     "Not in support of housing that is made to be torn down.  Very much in support  to build units that could later be used as afforadble housing.",
     "As long as they are not like the substandard temporary housing units that were built after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nHow about a long term approach.  Build modest ADU units on properties for owners to stay in while rebuilding takes place, then provides a potential revenue source that will support them when home construction is completed and adds additional housing units for the community or family.",
     "Not enough information on this option",
     "Where would that $$$ come from??? It seems like we need to just get on with the primary rebuilding.",
     "Instead, construct \"neighborhoods\" of permanent, fire hardened, affordable housing units (using prefab to the greatest extent possible) on properties that can ultimately be converted to tiny house or co-housing communitities.",
     "There needs to be help for people who have lost use of their homes even if they aren't able to rebuild, too.\n\nSo many people are renters who can't personally \"rebuild\" places and are at the mercy of landlords, many of whom are busy seeing dollar signs not relationships.\n\nThere's always ash, smoke, (and water) damage after a fire. Always. But assistance seems to only be available to those who owned a home that was burnt by fire as if ash and smoke don't exist and don't go to surrounding areas.\n\nMany of us lost our homes because they became unlivable and we aren't the ones allowed to fix them. Landlords drag their feet intentionally or otherwise. We need housing too.",
     "there are better ways to spend our money.",
     "I'm not sure I know enough to answer to this.",
     "If anything, trailers, but let's not waste time and man power building temporary structures",
     "I'm assuming this is for the cost of a tiny house or ADU while their house gets rebuilt.",
     "This is where modular homes, trailers and printed homes come in.  We need a locale in So. Calif where 20 or more types of modular and tiny homes can be built as displays.  This could happen on the Zorthian Ranch above the top of Fair Oaks Ave.",

     "This would be a nice option to help people with housing",
     "Yes, usually FEMA would handle this but that's defunct now. We need this to make sure that residents are not pushed out from the community if they want to rebuild/remain. Lessons from Lahaina should be carefully considered first.",

     "A trial program is the best option.",
     "build permanent housing and get this train rolling! temp housing creates a temp solution and wasted time",
     "Focus on TEMPORARY...we do not want such structures becoming future points of contention for affordable-housing advocates or homeless-advocates. These units should be removed from the fire-damaged communities once the homes are constructed.",
     "Its possible to build permanent housing inexpensively and fast. With innovative transportation, low cost land becomes practical for city workers. If you don't know the tech, well this absurd forum doesn't permit me to give URLs so don't critique this post as \"it doesn't exist.\"  If these solutions were already readily understood, then citizens would know about them but they aren't so \"voting\" and consensus has severe problems for making such complex choices when what we need is innovation.",
     "Altadena is full of toxic chemicals.  The soil has not been remediated.  It is not a safe place to live.  If these things are changed, then I would be supportive.",
     "This doesn't sound realistic at all. If you're going to build housing for displaced residents, I think the funding should go towards our rebuilds, please.",
     "It's nice in theory, but I don't see how it would be feasible. Where would the temporary units be located realistically? Parking lots, on the street, etc.? And once construction is finished, would these units in fact be removed or instead left in place and repurposed for low-income/homeless/transitional housing?  It also seems like it would be very costly, possibly taking away funds that could be used for the rebuilding efforts, community improvements, etc.",
     "again with the political fodder",
     "yeah it's crazy to spend this money twice. if folks can't afford to rent somewhere, they should get an easy to access, free permit to stay on their property in a tiny house or ADU while their house gets rebuilt. building extra buildings that won't be used after folks move is an insane use of money. spend that money to accelerate construction of houses on existing properties.",
     "As insurance runs out, things are going to get dire.  Giving people a place to live would be very helpful.",
     "I am strongly supportive at least in theory. But how this would actually play out - where there would be available space, how long it would take to get built are all questions that I doubt have easy answers. I think better still - make it easier for people to build small units on their lots or to live in tiny homes on wheels, preferably that they can keep after rebuilding.",
     "This doesn\u2019t seem as essential as it has been in Maui. Most displaced people that I know quickly found rental units.",

Look at how few housing units have been constructed for homeless people, not to mention the negative ROI on those investments with public money! What government should do is reduce regulations, ease tax and fee burdens, and otherwise use the regulatory tools within their power to enable faster recovery by the community itself.",

This could be much more efficiently done by state/local/tribal governments if they are ready.  For this disaster, FEMA did not initiate this program because they believed that their standard financial assistance was enough given sufficient rental resources in the area - not sure that was an entirely valid assumption.",

     "I'm strongly in support of this concept, but I'd want to know more about how this would be done.

TBH, PUSD would probably want as many school age families to come back as soon as possible as some have likely moved to other districts. \n\nHaving said that, I don't believe building back homes for families with children should take priority over say an elderly resident who may have financial constraints and needs to get back into their home quickly too.\n\nLoma Alta Park has been rebuilt.",

The emotional impact and grief for the loss of their homes and lives built in those homes is the same regardless of whether there were children in those homes. Financial impact, though relative-particularly if one has better insurance coverage than another-is also similar.",

     "As a mother, I understand the instinct to prioritize families with children, but recovery should be equitable. Many households without children also lost everything and need stable housing to begin healing. Our school wasn\u2019t impacted, and my kids had continuity, but many others, including elderly and vulnerable residents, did not. Rebuilding should focus on community-wide needs, not create tiers of worthiness based on family status.",

I'm also not excited about the idea of my young child returning to Altadena among all this construction.  I would rather stay out until the community is more complete, and then return for activities in Altadena.  At this time it's just too traumatic for her to return to Altadena and I feel for those there still.",

But there may be a highly resourced family with kids, who have second homes or who can easily rent in the area, while, say, seniors on fixed income have no good options.

I am single with no children and I can see the value in making sure children have a stable home environment... certainly everyone needs to be kept housed and healthy, but the emotional trauma of displacement is most acute for our youngest and most vulnerable neighbors, and this will stick with some of them for the rest of their lives. Between this and COVID, an entire generation is wounded before they even graduate from high school.",

I have heard/read many people say that, in the absence of soil remediation (including post-remediation) testing, they will just put an inch or two of mulch or compost on top and they're good to go.  Maybe that works for them because they don't have children, but it is short-sighted for the future of the community.

Double-paned windows are great in many respects, but the significantly higher cost could make this option out-of-reach for many homeowners.",

     "The 5 foot rule doesn't seem to work for everybody's properties. Like we have a little slope by ours that needs some vegetation or it'll be a big mess next time we get atmospheric rivers... it could have fire-resistant, and/or native, low plants though. I'm open to compromises and want a resilient rebuild. Our native trees also never caught, even when they had flames from our home right up against them. Additionally, is there a way for people who already have wood features to fire-proof (paint?) them if that's a major construction project otherwise? Or is this just for new builds? Will there be incentives to help elderly upgrade their properties? Community volunteer programs?",

We did everything we were supposed to do - had the mesh, had double paned windows, and in the end, any exposed wood became a hazard.  So are you going to ban any exposed wood?  Maybe for new builds, but seems very unrealistic for existing homes.  Maybe a better use of time and resources would be treatments and coatings for existing wood that would make it fire retardant.  Wire mesh over vents for sure, that's an easy one.  Same for chimneys.",
     "Again, this is bandaid. We need stuff that's highly statistically correlated with reducing fire risk, not just temp measures many of which are outrageously expensive and provide little value. Lobbyists pushing low relevance, high cost interventions.",

We must ensure anything the government promotes\u2014especially through requirements\u2014is backed by strong evidence from multiple high-quality studies. Also, let\u2019s avoid blanket requirements that ignore key facts. A concrete deck isn\u2019t a fire hazard. And while ipe is wood, it has a Class A fire rating\u2014same as concrete. I'm strongly opposed to this proposal. I have a standing home in the burn area with a deck, wooden fence, and original windows. I'm not tearing all that out. The cost would be prohibitive. Also, my windows are hand-crafted works of art\u2014forcing me to remove them would be devastating to me.",
     "Fire-resistant building rules are only effective if everyone follows them. What happens when a neighbor installs an unpermitted fence or structure too close to your home?

Clear guidelines are important, but so is ensuring they\u2019re applied fairly and enforced consistently.",

IF the government does what they should\u20141/ fill reservoirs 2/ position fire trucks 3/ patrol for arson and homeless encampments 4/ discourage density in high fire zones and 5/ underground powerlines we will be set.

     "Sounds excessive and unnecessary. Code overreach and cost increases",
     "I agree strongly with the 5 foot clearance, with the caveat that the guideline should be combustibles NOT vegetation (a 12 inch wide tree trunk with branches and leaves more than  5 ft from a structure is vegetation but not combustible; a pile of newspapers outside the front door is not vegetation, but is combustible). Mesh or fire rated vents should be enforced. Also add  light irrigation and pruning of the rest of vegetation - these are proven to help (Rubin, Keeley). Gates and decks again should be non-combustible or fire resistant, and that is not necessarily wood based. 4 inch thick wood gates are not combustible. Wood gates and decks painted with intumescent paint or that use Class A rated wood are not combustible.",
     "Yes to some, no others. None of this would have saved our house from burning down. That said, fine mesh over vents is essential. Double-paned windows for sure with new construction, but it\u2019s not fair to force existing homeowners to spend that much money. NO to the 5-foot clearance, it should be dependent on what types of vegetation. Some vegetation is low-risk and even fire-retardant.",
     "No brainer",
     "You should include upgrading to class A roof and enclosing eaves. Also, those two and double paned windows are very expensive, so a grant or tax break becomes very important. If financial help isn't available then focus on requiring vents, clearance and removing wood gates and decks. The permit office really doesn't understand how expensive this all is for most people. Also, provide expert advice from people who know, like firefighters, to come out and advise on this. It is imperative that it doesn't feel punitive or overly complex or difficult. Also expert help from people who know fire wise landscaping with native plants and trees so we aren't turning our community into a concrete slab.",

     "This assumes that this would have prevented the devastation from the fires which I find insulting.",
     "These are no brainer measures that should be required for all new construction and remodels. For existing homes, consider negotiating with contractors to establish neighborhood-scale programs that would enable groups of neighboring homeowners to access the necessary services (e.g., tree trimming, installation of fine mesh vent screens, etc.) at a discount.",

     "While we recognize the importance of fire safety, many of the suggested measures feel more reactive than preventative. My family has lived in Altadena for over 50 years, and this type of fire behavior\u2014reaching so far south and west\u2014is unprecedented in our experience. Vegetation around homes contributes to the beauty, character, and sense of belonging in our community. Altadena is not a planned development like those in Lancaster or Riverside; it has a unique, lived-in charm that we value deeply. We believe it's possible to rebuild wisely\u2014using smart, resilient design\u2014without sacrificing the essence of what makes Altadena home or giving in to fear-driven approaches.",

There may be better chances for dousing a fire in a wet environment than in a dry hot concrete environment that collects blowing embers. I am attending the forestry council meeting and learning more but most of their data is appropriate for large lots with homes far away from each other, not crowded 6500 sq foot lots with mcmansions on them with very little setbacks that burn because their next door neighbor is on fire. I have seen no data that debunks the idea that some irrigated vegetation is inferior to hardscape. I am a scientist and I don\u2019t see good data supporting zone 0.",

If these requirements are enforced or result in fines with non-compliance, then it risks disproportionately impacting lower-income community members. Framing this as recommendations for community would be better and having cities offer rebates for these recommended actions would be better.",
     "I\u2019m not sure this is achievable. Replacing decks and windows for example would be prohibitively expensive for many, and a 5\u2019 clearance doesn\u2019t take into account the realities of how homes were built.",

     "I did all of the recommendations at my house except a 5 barrier of plants around my house. But the planter was very low vegetation and my house burnt down anyway. So I'm not completely supportive of this measure. With 80 to 90 mph winds moving the fire I don't think much could have stopped it now that I've seen what happened at my house. I also had no exposed wood on the side of the house and a stone roof only 5 months old.",

In my neighborhood the brush was wild on state park and city property and our yards were maintained. I know we need to update our landscaping based on what's happened, but this feels like victim blaming and I'd rather see the state invest in this effort with us. At our house we learned that even ice plant will burn if you hold an unchecked wildfire to it for long enough.",

It was a significant investment and energy and time I devoted to my garden which was about 3 acres. I had everything cleared of weeds and mulched every one  of my trees and plants. Things were watered on automatic systems and inspected frequently for problems. I would do it all over again even having lost everything in this last fire. It is a passion to grow special trees and plants. Native plants might be more fire resistant but I don't grow plants because they are more resistant.",
     "I'm not opposed to this idea, but it seems like we're at the point where landscaping mandates are just a part of California life -- and we should implement them.

     "Interesting idea and somewhat supportive of it. My personal opinion is putting the same money into subsidies, rebates or tax breaks for installing fire-resistant landscaping or completing brush clearance would be much more effective.",
     "Down the road, yes.  But the priority should be rebuilding, restoring community identity, and getting people back in their homes.",
     "Particuarily if this was paired with a state buyback program to decrease population density and development on the WUI.

     "Agree with other comments that this is not top priority if rebuilding homes and infrastructure is needed. However, replacing landscapes with fire-resistant and waterfriendly landscaping does improve the systemic issues around ecosystems and climate change etc. Are there not already community associations dedicated to providing this resource to homeowners? Perhaps partner with them and/or provide grant money to help communities replace their landscaping with drought friendly/fire resistant plants.",

Ultra-violet light can kill pathogens with no chemicals.",
     "Great idea, but probably would require funding support from some public source.",
     "Honestly, can we dial it back on required, mandatory stuff? Even mandated solar was pulled back b/c it really doesn't provide a fire safety. Indoor fire sprinklers were kept as it can help knock down certain types of fires.\n\nTo mandate a greywater system, the state would have to subsidize it 100%",

People might use more ecofriendly products. could be hooked up to roof sprinklers. \nCon: Doesn't address standing homes. Space?\nConsiderations: cost, insurance discount? mosquitos, power requirements for pressure.",
     "Yes, this is very important. As a state and a country we have to get very much smarter at conscious water management given the long term challenges we face. It needs to start now. Solar power and grey water management should be a matter of course for rebuilding and new building in California.",

     "If this excludes when rebuilding this is a great idea.",
     "Love this idea! If possible with their land set-up, then yes. If there has to be a lot of rigamarole because it's the wrong landscape for a greywater system, then no.",
     "While I agree that this would be a great way to reuse the water, systems like this greatly increase the build cost. I think there might be a way to do this but would have to hear more from engineers as to how they would like to accomplish this.",
     "Just makes sense. Why throw useful water, away?",
     "Of course we should be doing this and using rain water (when we actually get it). \n\nI think this should be a retrofit in apartment buildings, too, especially those owned by these big corps who can afford to do this, have a big impact on water usage, and will on their own refuse to do something sensible like this. Most landlords collect rent and never do any upgrades or updates for decades. There is a massive impact on resources from apartment buildings but they always avoid improvements since they aren't \"new construction.\"",

     "Seriously! It is 2025 and we are still flushing toilets with DRINKING water! And we are watering outdoor plants with drinking water too! When the state is using nearly 20% of all its electricity to treat, move and deliver water, it is not only a water issue, it is also an energy issue. Less water demand means less energy to treat, pump and deliver that water. The cheapest gallon of water is the one we don't have to source!",
     "Reduce, reuse, and recycle is how we lower our footprint! This is a great idea!",

     "Fixing and maintaining the reservoirs should be the priority. Many homes / buildings had swimming pools full of water that could have been used to put out fires but weren't used. Thus, conserving water, although important for our environment, is not a fire mitigation strategy.",

     "I guess, but what are the environmental issues from this?",
     "I think this is a no brainer if cost effective.",
     "I strongly support graywater systems. Two caveats 1) they require ecological detergents/soaps, which are almost impossible to enforce; 2) the County makes it hard to permit them, and fire survivors should not be overburdened with more rules. Therefore, I oppose requiring them, and support fast tracking permitting, and providing incentives and education to increase their use.",
     "Not sure if it needs to be mandatory due to increased expense, but would be nice if it were incentivized.  Especially if you build a water tank on your property that can be used for irrigation and/or emergency home defense.",
     "I wouldn\u2019t mandate it yet, because there aren\u2019t enough businesses out there to build these systems (I know, I tried to do it). Create a tax incentive or rebate program to encourage it, which will encourage more businesses to offer this service.",
     "Having installed a grey water system at great expense only to have to abandon it later because the San Diego based company who installed it would not service it, I am a little wary. Conceptually a great idea but in practice more difficult!!",
     "It should be optional. It could skyrocket costs. It should not be mandatory.",
     "Good idea. Help people cover the cost and give them expert advise with no hassle. Pasadena water and power had a free, easy grey water program. They vetted the contractor, he did the install, they paid him, we send water from our washing machine to our native rain garden, native bushes grow, birds eat the berries, i watch the birds...easy, no hassle, win win win.  However, if you make it yet another permit, yet another inspection, yet another fee, yet another trip to the hardware store, yet another search for a reliable contractor that will hand you a sky high bill for something you may not think you want or need and you will add to the mountain of similar red tape that is home ownership in California.",
     "Over complication. Ongoing maintenance. Uncertainty of supply.",
     "Already left comment about this....totally supportive. Want to install grey water system myself, but not sure how or where to begin.",
     "Regulate agriculture better. Mandatory drip systems would save far more water than coming after house hold use which barely uses any of the water in the state compared to agricultural use. Far too long we've given ag a free pass to use water irresponsibly because of some fake propaganda that they're feeding America when a large portion of their product is exported anyway. Treat them like a business that uses a public resource and relinquish the fake romance.",
     "It is a waste of water to send grey water down the drain and not into the ground. Especially if used to keep vegetation live - trees and greenery outside the 5 ft radius of houses in Palisades didn\u2019t burn and the fire was actually inhibited from spreading house to house in many cases because of the vegetation.",
     "Minimal additional expense with large retuns over time.",
     "This should be recommended,  maybe rewarded but not mandatory",
     "Not sure how much water this would save relative to the increase in construction costs. Cost- Benefit analysis would be important.",
     "As long as the upgrade will be covered by insurance",
     "I don't agree with any Mandatory item being put on homeowners.  Again this is reactive and fear driven.",
     "Graywater being mandatory can have unintended consequences. When it's the choice of the family putting in the system, they're more likely not dump harmful chemicals into the earth. If it's mandatory, you would need to couple that with essentially eliminating the ability for a person to ever purchase the kind of dumpable chemicals that could find their way to our groundwater. As for a water-saving technique, it's also minimal compared to the water-waste of corporations who don't face anywhere near this stringent of a regulation.",
     "As much as people complain about So Cal, no one is leaving So Cal in droves. There are only going to be more and more people. Until LA has adopted desalination techniques to more adequately meet the water needs of coastal communities, reusing greywater maybe need to be looked into.",
     "There are better ways to conserve water than greywater systems.  If you don't use the proper soaps you can cause more damage to the soil.  This is a really bad idea.",
     "Good idea but not if it's going to increase the cost of my rebuild a lot.",
     "I support this because in any way we can we should be working to conserve and recycle water.  This is already being done in northern California, so it's concerning that it seems like this is not something that is being done in southern California already, where water is more scarce and should be considered more valuable.  It really makes me question the leaders in charge of the water management system in SoCal, and what they have been doing with all of the money they have been getting from the state, feds and rate payers and why they are so concerned with buying land in the Delta, which they have purchased, when they should be upgrading their current water management system and work on better managing the water they currently have.",
     "Yes, I think this is the future, but maybe not the appropriate time for it. We can\u2019t financially afford to rebuild what we had, adding more requirements can be costly and a possible deterrent.",
     "Good way to build in sustainability measures, what I'm worried about is the upfront cost of this if it's a requirement. Need to make sure its more of a carrot not a stick approach, as people are frustrated with all forms of govt in general right now",
     "Can standing homes though be retrofitted to install greywater systems?",
     "Some projects may not be able to accommodate greywater systems. Might be voluntary for small residential projects. Note: residential showers and sinks sometime contain fecal material; treatment & dilution to insignificant fractions might be necessary.",
     "I don't see this as contributing to fire safety.",
     "I love the forward thinking, but we as residents should not be burdened with additional expenses. What cost implications are associated with these systems?",
     "Concerned abt the cost for people already overextended on their rebuilding.",
     "Has to be in the right community with the right landscape to be useful.",
     "Another cog in the wheel.  This is why only 6 permits have been issued in over 6 months!!  These people will interject so many restrictions, these homes will never be rebuilt.  And we haven't even talked about the Coastal Commission restrictions.   Government bringing the process right down to a complete halt.\n\nPathetic.",
     "If it\u2019s made affordable I\u2019m all for it",
     "It's a fine idea in general but I don't think it would have helped with the fires. We can incentivize people by making sure they have to pay for the true costs of the resources they use. Homeowners should be able to look at the water rates and see the cost savings of greywater systems themselves.",
     "We should\u2019ve been doing this a long time ago. This would increase our water availability for fires.",
     "Isn't it more economical for larger scale processing of gray water?  Talking about affordable housing.....beyond mortgage and rent, it's  tax and more taxes.",
     "I feel this would be a burdensome regulation on rebuilding",

     "Yes smart to do for many reasons, where possible as it makes sense.",
     "This is a punitive financial requirement to residents. Just let the water flow and be stored where it's needed.",
     "What a wonderful idea! I've never heard of this. My only concern would be if this would cost more for folks who are rebuilding.",
     "I think using grey water for the garden would be an excellent idea. Currently the building department doesn't  allow retrofitting plumbing for grey water systems. It would significantly reduce the sewer charges to residential houses. Of course it's would be money lost to utility companies so I imagine they will be fighting this concept. It would add to plumbing construction cost but in think the saving would offset  this expenses fairly quickly.",
     "Mandatory burdens on homeowners should be reduced, not increased. If you want to encourage people to take this path, then offer then rebates or tax reductions by doing so - and lead by example by starting with all government facilities first.",
     "Education on the option but not required",
     "I'm interested in this anyway, but concerned that making it a requirement would end up costing some people much more than others, so I'd be more interested in an incentive program instead of a mandate.",
     "Rebuild costs are high enough already, we don't need additional construction costs for greywater systems here. Create a tax break, incentive or a rebate for this, not a regulation.",
     "Sure. I\u2019ve looked into this before and it was prohibitively expensive and not recommended for lawns.",
     "We are planning on do this. Make more affordable and efficient.",
     "Mandates like this are often costly and often people don\u2019t want the retrofits",
     "A great idea, but won't this raise the cost of rebuilding?",
     "I love this idea\u2014it's a smart, sustainable step forward. To make it accessible, we should ensure there are ways to offset the costs through grants, incentives, rebates, or tax credits. That way, more people can afford to install greywater systems and contribute to long-term water conservation.",

     "This is a great idea - who's paying?",
     "Yes yes yes and can we also have tax breaks/incentives for existing construction to install? Critics will argue that this will raise water rates and the cost of rebuilding but this is a huge and important investment in our future sustainability as a city.",
     "As a landscape architect, I know that gray water reuse requires dedication and commitment to be effective.  Mandating it for people who aren\u2019t prepared to understand it would be disastrous and wasteful.",
     "I support this only if it's subsidized or if rebates are provided. Rebuilding is expensive enough, can't this be addressed or mandated after people have their homes back?",
     "We should encourage water sustainability and also use this rebuilding opportunity to take measures to reduce carbon impacts of buildings such as solar and electric appliances. Climate change was a significant driver of this disaster and we have a critical opportunity to make meaningful change by building back in a way that will lessen our climate footprint for generations rations to come and prevent future disasters like this.",

There are a tremendous number of factors involved with rebuilding a home. It will require a great deal money, expertise, cooperation from city and building inspectors and coordination to rebuild 16,000 houses I personally think it will take more than 10 years to even put a dent in that number of houses to be rebuilt. Families won't have the time or money to invest in rebuilding their homes. They will have more immediate concerns and problems raising their children.",

     "Great. But start by streamlining the process. Then make sure everyone at the permit office knows that new process inside and out and finally make sure every permit office has one person who is responsible for everything that people who work under them says. Then go out engage with homeowners. If you really want to keep another fire like the last one from happening again or at least seriously reduce the damage, then make all areas within the ember zone subject to fire audits.

     "Knowledge is power but easily forgotten. Use tech to make homes \"Explain themselves\" to their current and future owners. The bigger problem is Veto-ocracy and the resistance of licensing agencies to permit innovative solutions to current housing problems. For instance,  a toilet using water should simply be illegal. Make efficient appliances affordable and easy to install. You can't depend on capitalism to make this happen.",
     "I don't know how many people actually care about understanding the whys or wherefores of the code. They just want to know what they have to do and how they can do that the easiest. Resources already exist for people who want to know more: google and the permitting office to start.",
     "Obviously building to the latest housing standards is a good idea and there should be education and financial support. But the focus on these types of questions in this survey feels like focusing on what homeowners should do more so than focusing on the improvements needed on our emergency management systems. Why focus on saving homes when we haven't figured out how to save people? There has been only 1 question so far about improved emergency communications. And none about improving evacuation support readiness.",
     "Focus instead on making the processes simpler, transparent, properly staffed, and technologically advanced.",
     "This information is readily available to anyone faced with the rebuilding process. Resources need to be concentrated in areas that really matter.",
     "Permit, codes, rebuilding, insurance needs to be cleaned up, clarified,  made more simple. It's a convoluted mess that overwhelms victims who are already overwhelmed by trauma & loss",
     "Not sure it would make a difference.   People who cares are already knowledgeable.  Others are for whatever reasons will not, until the next disaster which affects them directly, when it's  too late.",
     "We don\u2019t have the time or capacity to learn all these complex building codes and permit requirements on top of healing from trauma, working full-time, raising a family, etc. It would be crucial to involve architects and contractors who understand the process, and incentivize them to actively support and educate homeowners. This would ease the burden on survivors and help rebuild more efficiently without adding stress during an already overwhelming time.",
     "I would be good if there was a pre-fire analysis of what this area situation was before the fire.   Also explain that this was an urban fire with a wildfire component.  Update building standards would have prevented this situation.",
     "I actually think this could be helpful for those that take advantage of it. I work in commercial real estate, and even I've had quite a learning curve embarking on the rebuild process. I can't imagine how daunting this must seem to homeowners who aren't familiar with the residential development process.",
     "Might as well encourage cat herding.",
     "Yes, but usually it's the architects and/or builders that will be working with the city and they already know the rules and they're still being put through stupid checks that go nowhere and take time and cost money.  If you really want to help homeowners, MAKE THIS FAST AND EASY.  More education is not the answer, order all affected cities/counties to eliminate all requirements beyond an over the counter approval for homeowners rebuilding a similar home.",
     "It would be great to have a GIS map showing the insurance rates that existed in areas that burned or could burn to raise awareness.",
     "I'd love one clear manual. We have information overload though, so it needs to be simple or please don't bother.",
     "There needs to be more accountability with insurance, especially with transparency regarding dwelling limits and how they are calculated. It is my understanding that almost all of Altadena was underinsured.  At least we know that we are drastically. It be great to understand our rights. And how to prevent others from suffering in the future.",
     "Providing resources to help navigate these processes would also be extremely important.",
     "There is a lot of information coming from a lot of people, organizations and companies.  Its hard to decipher.  Idle promises, not clear direction all the above make it very difficult to plan and follow through on rebuilding. There should be clearer information share by approved or recognized organization.",
     "Community based resilience efforts are important but should not take the place of necessary municipal, county and state response",
     "Let relevant industries absorb and apply this knowledge.",

     "It already exists.",
     "Not sure how this helps the building permit process.",
     "When your entire community burns down, these hubs would have to be in many areas as not all community members relocate to the same place.

     "I support this idea but it should have been in place and it wasn\u2019t. If this is gonna require giving grants to schools to make it happen I want to be involved to make sure those grants are used for what they are intended for.",
     "I think this is important for future planning, but not a priority right in this moment given the need to rebuild schools in our fire-damaged locations. But planning for this as we rebuild could make sense -- picking central locations to create central gathering points. But in terms of aid in the next six to twelve months -- I feel like that info is best circulated through the previously described database.",
     "The burden of aiding the suffering of a natural disaster shouldn't be imposed on a community.",
     "Too little too late. Many of these recommendations seem to misread the room entirely. Being prepared to effectively alert and evacuate people in a future emergency is so much more important than these \"nice to have\" suggestions, but seems to be totally ignored so far in this survey.",
     "Yes, but it doesn't really feel like this would be executed effectively. Also, our community spaces burned.",

     "Our schools and library burnt. It\u2019s fine to have a central location but we need to focus on Internet communication to spread the word.",
     "Yes, a few libraries which did not burn, adjacent to burn areas can and should do this.  No libraries generally.",
     "Making public spaces accessible for mutual aid networks is a great idea that's overdue. The greatest untapped resource in Los Angeles is Angelenos.",
     "I feel like we sort of did this. It would be great to have more locations, but only if there's good communication and money is well used. Good to have a place to charge devices and use WiFi. Grief support. Pet friendly. Kids activities. legal guidance for renters.\n\nHonestly I used Watch Duty App to see most easily where the resource centers were and where world kitchen was that day.",
     "The more resources and information the better",
     "During wildfire, those places within the impacted communities may be too risky for people to be in or return to. Obviously as long as it is safe, this is a good idea, but how it is done is critical. After Woolsey and Palisades, there were community events at schools and libraries. The one after Woolsey was only heartening insofar as it gave survivors a place to meet up, but the content was tone deaf and difficult for survivors to take. These will be helpful only insofar as the help is deeply trauma informed and relevant. The Zuma camp and World Kitchen during and after Palisades was exemplary for medical aid and food.",
     "Resources are needed, yes.",
     "Especially libraries, the more community use they get, the better.",
     "Isn't this what the Red Cross already does? Doubtful that any government-managed program could do this effectively or efficiently, plus it would probably soak up a huge amount of tax dollars that could be refunded to victims to deploy for themselves.",

     "One outlet providing consolidation of all vetted, important information would be optimal.  Not on social media.",
     "The way this is worded, I can't tell if you are asking if these should be set up for our intimidate needs or if this is a longer term suggestion for future emergencies. I think it's the former, the the language \"during emergencies\" makes it sound like the latter.",
     "Not sure what this means. If using these places for temporary emergency shelter, that seems ok but don\u2019t think u need to store beds food emergency supplies beyond the normal operation of business",
     "I didn't see this as an issue in the Palisades fire",
     "That's fine if that's what the current needs are for the community.",
     "You're missing the BEST hub- Non-political service organizations, like Churches, etc., then continue with as-small-as-possible government outlets.",
     "Ok. But before doing that the government needs to get its own inter-agency communications hub with all agencies having a rep and a place where they meet regularly so they are all talking to each other and working together before the next disaster so when it happens they are prepared. Perhaps they can have community points of contact in the community hubs to help disseminate clear and consistent information and not rely on third party, for profit companies like those found on social media or random unaffiliated mobile apps or some third party AI outsourced company.",
     "We all stay connected via social media. The FEMA Center in Westwood served this purpose perfectly. Train seniors how to use social media. They were definitely disadvantaged during this crisis. The solution is teaching them and one center with one-stop shopping. Not a bunch of differently smaller locations that lack the experts.",

     "I appreciated the annual reminder from our fire dept to brushes etc.  But need more enforcement in a timely manner.  Most residents comply, but always a few who do not, for reasons unknown.  That's where timely enforcement can id trouble spots and find solutions.  It only takes one tiny fire to grow into uncontrollable fire.",
     "Absolutely no property taxes during rebuild and no matter what the replacement, fire victims should automatically go back to their original rate.",
     "All property owners, if they properly maintain their properties including but not limited to brush clearance, roof, paint, electrical, water, etc should get tax breaks.  Imagine how nice our city will look and how pleasant it would be for all residents",
     "This is a slippery slope and an argument can be made for both sides. I'm all for tax breaks but I think an argument can be made both ways. Part of being a responsible homeowner is paying stuff like property tax. I think there are other enforcement measures that can be taken that don't involve property tax breaks.",
     "There is legislation being proposed on the tax break. Question is too simplistic, how much tax break?   Why not provide this information with the question?",
     "Yep. Gov't often times puts the onus on the homeowner. Creating fire breaks, brush clearance (using goats), enforcing utility maintenance etc. always seems to come last.",
     "Defensible fire space is already somewhat rewarded by insurance companies",
     "It encourages good practices",
     "Reward system is better than punitive restrictions",
     "Zoning to rule out consruction on, or very near, fire prone zones comes first.",
     "Better building materials (e.g. earth/adobe) which will also help with climate change; education on how to work with the land, and subject to fines if not maintained.",
     "I thought this was already in place",
     "This their home insurers job.",
     "To be effective, incentives and enforcement are required.",
     "I'm supportive if the guidelines are attainable and actually saves people money. Blanket rules won't apply to the wide variety of properties, and our sycamore never burned, even when the flames from our house were against it. It kept the house cooler for nearly 50 years. We definitely need a path towards tax breaks though after what we've been through. ...Must say, I feel like we already earned that when our homes were all incinerated though?",
     "I do not want to have to debate WHY I should be able to keep my fire resistant camellia or oak tree are in proximity to my home and will help me in a fire. The BOF and their insurance compatriots writing the Zone Zero final rules do not want ANY nuance. They are on record saying that they do not know the difference between an oak and a eucalyptus. They want it ALL cut down. They also will force us to remove our hedges if they are within 30 feet of our homes. I do not want the government telling me how to landscape my yard. Again\u2014the HOMES are the fuel for the fires NOT our vegetation!",
     "There are other ways to mitigate for fires.",
     "The trees and landscape are not what caused the fires.  In fact, many homes were saved because of trees' canopies (like on Christmas Tree Lane).  We need solutions that include working with the land.",
     "It might be the only way to get people to take pro-active action",
     "Defensible space is great, but if we encourage everyone to cut everything down we're going to make the place hotter, too. Which will increase fire risk. We need to a path to implement better policies that are less generic and more wise.",
     "Yes.  Homeowners go to great effort and cost to do that and should be supported by the city with one-on-one education for each property and cost relief.",
     "I think that's a great idea. I certainly did that at our orchard but it didn't help with an 80 to. 90 mph winds. It would have been nice to be rewarded for all my efforts maintaining our house and yes surrounding grounds. I even had the Malibu Fire inspectors review our house to encourage fire prevention.",
     "Insurance companies need to work in tandem with homeowners to recognise the expense and efforts we will enable around our property to make it more fire resistant.",
     "How would this be monitored for compliance?",
     "This would not have made any difference in these fires.  Lowering taxes and giving people an incentive is fine as long as the cost to do so isn\u2019t more than the benefit.  This should be an OPTIONAL choice by homeowners.",
     "Incentivize wise building practices to avoid future problems",
     "It's good to provide a reward, especially financial",
     "Too hard to enforce, too fussy. Encourage in other ways.",
     "Yup. I would only question how that regular maintenance would be verified. I think you could do one off tax breaks to property owners or groups of property owners who do fire hardening upgrades to their homes. If so please make sure it is retroactive so as not to put off people who have done that or are doing that now.",
     "Incentives would be nice to have but I think that all homeowners should have to participate even without incentives,",
     "property owners should be doing this without tax accommodations. Other communities do this and tax breaks for a few is not necessary",
     "We need to focus on the brush clearance that does not happen in our surrounding state parks and home owners associations and city/county owned land. We have had fire starts on irrigated land belonging to homeowners and no huge configuration results. Our huge fires come from our brushy state owned land that isn\u2019t cleared in proximity to our communities. That is where we need to focus, not on Zone 0. The rest of the control measures in the question are good ones though and giving incentives is probably a good idea",
     "Reward-based systems work well!",
     "Pro: reward effort\nCon: wont incentivize renters or individuals with already low property tax. Doesn't provide guidance or assistance on how to do this. Doesn't address other causes of fire. \nconsideration: what about other types of fire hardening could be part of this? Where do the insurance companies stand on giving discounts on this type of effort?",
     "ABSOLUTELY YES. Incentivize people making a decision that will protect not only themselves but their neighbors too.",
     "Insurance companies are typically leading the charge in monitoring and enforcing brush clearance and defensible properties. In wildfire-hazard zones (e.g., wilderness interface), they have been on top of this for a generation.",
     "Very strongly support. The reason I lost my home was that the fire spread from the Alphabet Streets into the brush behind our home/Rivas Canyon. Proper brush clearance may have made a difference.",
     "I do not believe tax breaks to homeowners for defensible space is a good idea. Property taxes are a huge source of funding for critical social insurance programs (as well as schools) and lowering revenue for critical functions of government is not a good idea. Rather, using private sector incentives (lower insurance premiums or being insured in the first place) is a better approach to this.",
     "Clear cutting our properties is a terrible idea.  We need a lot more nuance in landscape guidelines.",
     "Incentive programs are great!",
     "Definitely I\u2019ve known a few people who have very tall trees that need to be cut or pruned but it\u2019s very expensive , even dead trees in the street in my neighborhood who should be removed by the city of LA which is non responsive , these are potential hazards for fires . The tax rebate should covers those high prices for removal by private tree trimming companies .",
     "This sounds great but we\u2019ve always had to clear brush or we were fined by the city. Any tax break would be welcome",
     "Again, creating defensible space and fire-proofing homes is the single most important action that can mitigate fire. I strongly support this.",
     "Not sure exactly what this means. Not in favor of the 5 foot clearance but do think it is important for neighbors to regularly clear and maintain brush.",
     "Good idea for incentives rather than simple mandates, no downside",
     "I'm all for carrots, but in this case, I am also fine with sticks \u2013 mandate brush clearing and fine for violations.",
     "Home hardening should be obligatory, and made easy with subsidies, tax breaks or even just dedicated crews doing the work with independent inspectors assessing what needs to be done and fraud prevention auditors verifying the work of inspectors.",
     "It does no good to have only some homeowners participate in the fire-resistance of their homes - it has to be a full neighborhood approach.",
     "I think there is great opportunity to engage communities in this kind of activity. Many countries and cultures treat landscape safety and maintenance as a collective activity. I think any incentives should be directed toward encouraging community engagement which will have other kinds of social benefits too.",
     "How does this apply to condo owners, townhome owners, mobile home owners, and renters?",
     "we cant answer questions without further info...",
     "I marked neutral on this. If the property has that much land surrounding the building, then yes, require clearing. But many residences don't have 5 feet between them in the first place. This cannot be a one size fits all solution.",
     "I think you should just fine them if they don't do this. This really isn't hard to do.",
     "Reporting on the science is contradictory",
     "This seems to have only benefits, though I don't know how effective it would be.",
     "We definitely need more enforcement and incentizing is a soft form of enforcement. Insurance companies should also provide incentives. They promise it, but so far Fair Plan hasn't delivered after nearly 2 years of our trying.",
     "It seems like it would be more important to get insurance companies on board for this - will they agree to insure home that do this? Or insure at a lower rate?",
     "Could work but what would happen if a home owner could not afford to do this?",
     "better option is rebate systems like we saw for solar and grant systems for those who can demonstrate economic need.",
     "There needs to be oversight.",
     "Residents need guidance and support here.",
     "of course",
     "Apply it to the property's HOA or the landlord",
     "A good idea without consideration for implementation or cost.  A better question needed, so \"neutral.\"",
     "If we do the work we should get the credit",
     "I would need to see the definitions of defensible space to know if I would support this or not. If it means removing well maintained native plants, for example, I'm guessing this is more destructive than helpful in a suburban environment.",
     "Prioritize home hardening, not just landscape maintenance. \nAlso, ensure that affordable landscape maintenance assistance is available to homeowners who are physically unable to do the work themselves.",
     "Great for future disasters. It won't help us.",
     "But what does this have to do with rebuilding burnt down homes?",
     "this can happen later. we need laborers now, not in two years.",
     "Would it really make a difference? Seems like a good long term idea but will take years to feel the impact of (probably after much of the rebuild has begun).",
     "Increased man power is a good thing",
     "As noted in the Blue Ribbon Commission: Supporting a Resilient and Sustainable Rebuild report, there is a shortage of construction workers. Efforts that intentionally work to address this shortage and strengthen a school-to-career pathway should be prioritized. Consider offering stipends to students or paid apprenticeships (post-high school) to incentivize the continued training.",
     "Seems like a long time to get rebuilt if we still have to train people.",
     "Since historic housing stock was lost to the fire, and many people are rebuilding in traditional styles or moving old houses for the purpose of restoring them, this concept could be expanded to include the traditional building trades--brick laying, plastering, tile setting (for the salvaged Batchelder and other art tiles held by the Save the Tiles nonprofit), wood floor installation, etc.",
     "This will take far too long for LA to recover.",
     "This is a good option: I would encourage both public and private sector to increase community outreach (especially in lower socioeconomic-strata neighborhoods) along with looking at formerly-incarcerated populations for this. Increasing the pool of eligible workers in all of the various trades (construction, plumbing, electricians, carpentry, etc) will only benefit society as a whole- not just post wildfire LA.",
     "if the time horizon for training matches the need, sure. if it takes 3 years to implement, then 2 years to start graduating people, it's a bad use of money.",
     "Sounds promising but skeptical if this works fast enough or will be effective.",
     "Not essential this minute but yes in the big picture. For now, prevent ICE from terrorizing/deporting our construction and landscape workers!",
     "I have worked in career technical education in CA for over 20 years.  These is an INCREDIBLE amount of funding for this and never gets implemented on an efficient scale.",
     "We need to do this even if the fire hadn't happened.",
     "Seems like something out of reach for the current situation.",
     "Always supportive of helping train local youth in the trades.",
     "These are such political fodder. This is a great idea that no one will ever do. The fires will be forgotten until they happen again.",
     "As stated above, these are essential skills that can't be replaced by AI. They are also practical, typically require less schooling and allow people to start earning a living earlier than a traditional college degree.",
     "This feels more of a nation-wide crisis where fewer people have gone into trades and opted for 4-year universities. This should not be in this recovery focus but more of a wider focus and conversation.",
     "What a cool idea! I'm supportive as long as it is well designed, organized, and managed. A good program like this could help our community in multiple ways, but a poorly planned and organized program would just be flushing money down the toilet. Also, why just high school grads? Let's let anyone who is interested join!",
     "My community has been hit hard by immigration raids. The children left behind that are of age post high school could use the support and this would help create a healthy middle class.",
     "I don't really see this being ready in time to help the fire rebuild. It would be cool to mobilize student teams to help with various related projects though.",
     "I'm all about supporting education, I just don't know what exists and if our current graduates would do this.",
     "Getting skilled and trained construction workers ready for rebuilding is a critical step. As a consumer, it's really hard to know when sub-contractors (and sub-sub-contractors) are qualified to do the work they are hired to do, so expanding training opportunities will help with this. Also please invite construction workers from other states to California, and subsidize their temporary housing while they are helping us rebuild.",
     "Yes.  Include forests apprenticeships.  IBEW represents loggers already. There is plenty of good logging for training in the Angeles NF, reducing fire risks around San Berdoo.",
     "Great long term solution, but need more in the short and near term.",
     "Let the market solve this. Where there is demand they will come.",
     "Worthless if they are just going to build conventional buildings. But not if they build passive houses, water recycling within-building systems. Heat pumps with thermal (not electrical) batteries (like oversized domestic hot water tanks) are more efficient.",
     "If there is a silver lining to any of this, it would be an opportunity to engage young people in well-paying trades and help to rebuild their community at the same time. Excellent idea.",
     "Not sure LAUSD is equipped to do this",
     "Not sure why the state would be involved in this? Trade and tech schools should be taking the lead on this. If the state wants to increase spending at said schools in an effort to reach more potential students, go for it, but leave the teaching to the schools.",
     "As a side note, is there also an opportunity to engage with volunteers who want to help?",
     "I support this for any number of reasons.",
     "Sounds like a bureaucratic way to waste tax dollars",
     "This is a great solution! Allowing high school students to train in the Palisades and Eaton fire rebuilding areas is a genius idea to get them hands on experience.",
     "It has to come with some meaningful incentive.  I remember the days when young people dropped out of teacher training, because there were more lucrative opportunities.",
     "Not sure why this is necessary; aren\u2019t there already training programs?",
     "Bringing shop classes back to school is an excellent suggestion. I took all the shop courses in addition to all my academic courses. Giving young students an opportunity to learn physical skills is very helpful and expands the experience of the students too in a very positive environment",
     "supportive but why only hight school graduates?",
     "Many programs like these are initiated after major disasters and while important in and of themselves, they rarely create substantive new labor resources quickly enough for the current disaster.",
     "Yes we needed this even before the fires. Please consider pipelines for women. These are family sustaining jobs!",
     "This is a fantastic idea - helping folks NOW and also offering new skill sets for the next generation and generations to come.  Fully support this!!",
     "I support this completely as many residents don't how to use basic tools or have basic understanding about how things work  (e.g. how to shut off their gas valve)",
     "This is best a long term solution to a worker shortage.  How about some sort of workers permits for illegal aliens.",
     "These trades have been overlooked and under-promoted for years. Having programs in place to help graduates enter apprentice to journeyman-type training paths would be valuable.",
     "Doesn't seem related to the fire, but it's a good opportunity to expand the options of high school students.",
     "Train them only in the most leading edge thinking on how to build for the future of more wildfires, more floods, less reliable public services etc. The next generation of builders can\u2019t build resilient structures if their education doesn\u2019t put that into the center of their education.",
     "I think its a good idea and should be looked into",
     "We might have a major labor shortage coming soon so I guess it won't hurt.",
     "This great for many reasons beyond rebuilding after the fire.  These are middle class jobs available to everyone and don't require expensive college debts.",
     "Recent immigration actions have significantly negatively impacted the disaster rebuilding workforce. We need all the help we can get to get the job done.",
     "Ensure that any such training prioritizes decommissioning gas lines and constructing fire-resistant, energy efficient, all-electric buildings.",
     "I agree that this needs to be done- but why with a fire rebuilding program? High schools never should have eliminated wood shop, industrial arts, horticulture and auto shop to begin with.",
     "This would be great to provide anyway...And this is a fantastic long-term idea. We should start this now, but it won't help too much in the interim. We need immediate solution in addition to this.",
     "Absolutely\u2014expanding apprenticeships in the building trades is crucial. Let\u2019s also include training in passive home construction, so the next generation builds homes that can withstand climate challenges like weather whiplash. Adopting progressive standards, like those already used in Europe by deafult, will make our communities safer, more resilient, and more energy-efficient.",
     "I'm not against this but I'm a former tradesman who went back to school. This farce that trades make great money is an illusion. Construction workers are often exploited and survive feast/famine depending if they're getting overtime wages. We should be doing our best to drive up wages which will naturally attract people to these fields through labor protections and effective organizing incentives.",
     "Great. I would expand that to all citizens who are willing and able, possess a can do attitude and can pass a drug test.",
     "Yes, we need more electricians, plumbers, and general construction workers no only to build all the new electric infrastructure required with all-electric buildings, but to maintain the existing infrastructure. For example, there is a parking structure near me that has EV public charging and most chargers are broken. For many who own an EV and are unable to charge at home, it is crucial that we both build AND maintain the infrastructure. We will also need workforce and infrastructure to decommission and recycle solar, batteries and wind turbines as they reach their end-of-life.",

Financial responsibility/budgeting, healthy food prep, and the overall managing of a household are often difficult to figure out on one's own, especially if someone didn't have parents who were good in those areas either.",
     "While more training of trades people is important it seems adjacent to this effort and should be done but not as part of the rebuilding process.",
     "Amazing and trade eduction in High School like it is done in other countries would be very beneficial.  The rebuild is going to take years and there is a shortage and young people need a path to a job which most high classes are not doing.",

Won't be a copy of your home. \nConsiderations: provide variety of design (craftsman, janes cottage, mid century etc) and variety of finish to create diversity.",
     "This really depends upon how much uptake could be expected for generic plans.  Development and use of these types of plans is common in rebuilding programs using HUD CDBG-DR funds.",
     "It would depend on the architectural creativity of the available plans for the program. I'm not interested in building mushroom like box houses devoid of style and originality. These designs would have to be modifiable to make them differentiate from each other. Other wise you would just be building condos that are separated by space. Designs for a 1,100 sq ft house will be significantly different from a 3,000 or 5,000 sq ft house.   In Malibu there was tremendous variation in house designs within our community.",
     "I'm very good with this. If it were mandated that you HAD to use a pre-approved design, that would probably be bad, but if there is an option to go with something that will be faster and thus cheaper, or to go it your own was,y then I feel like everyone has a choice.",
     "This is gross, and counter the art and CULTURE and goes against what makes the unique architecture of Cali.  Instead, provide options for free consultancy on these standards and work directly with LOCAL architects.",
     "That's already happening, but it could be improved by allowing some leeway for changes to plans. For example, a homeowner might like a four-bedroom plan, but would like to build it with only three bedrooms. Or perhaps change the inside layout slightly.",
     "Wow...this makes the unsupported presumption that Altadenans want their community to look like a giant tract development.  And why don't you foist a giant HOA on Altadena while you're at it?",

     "This is a great idea. You're not forcing anyone to use plans they don't want, but you're making available plans so that they can use them if it makes sense, and it streamlines the process.",
     "I'd only support this if the pre-approved designs are a reasonable design for normal people to buy and not a hand out to developers to create McMansions. I'm also against giving handouts for only Multi-Family housing. This is basically a hand out to large corporate landlords. I'd support this if a housing co-op system was enacted like they do in New York City where tenants would own their unit.",
     "Streamlined approval for designs should reflect the variety of historic building styles lost in the fires, as restoring the look of home will help with healing. Such work is already being done by the community organization The Foothill Catalog Foundation.",

     "If the plans can be customized without a significant additional costs this would be good.  Otherwise it just another planned community.",
     "Agreed, but there should also be considerations for the potential extra loads added to the grid. Affordable and efficient solar + battery storage hookups should be considered to have generation to support the potential increase in energy use.",
     "The best fire-resistant homes and buildings burn down when the existing fuel in surrounding areas is left unmanaged, droughts occur, and winds follow. We can guarantee future droughts. We can guarantee future wind events. We can guarantee fire-resistant homes and buildings will burn when the fire inevitably ignites.\n\nWhat we CAN control is brush and undergrowth.  We can control defensible space around buildings. We can control natural fire breaks.",
     "Not for me, but i can see the benefits for others",
     "all of this is a yes",
     "All new future construction and home buildings should be fire resistant moving forward and if not then no permit .",
     "As long as there is some true LA variety in there this is great. We had fun funky neighborhoods. No one wants cookie cutter.",
     "This is concerning due to a number of factors... Who is making these designs? Who is benefiting, why are they benefiting, and who else does it benefit more after that? While fire safety standards should be in place, particular plans for building seems to make things more exclusive, rather than inclusive, especially for certain businesses that may benefit. That doesn't sound good... Sounds like more room for corruption, for the capability of it moreover. Just things to consider I guess",
     "There should not be gas infrastructure allowed back in these high danger fire zones. It is cheaper to build all electric homes, they are safer, more efficient and better for the community.",
     "Part of the charm of Altadena is all the different styles of Architecture. Although I support the foothill catalogue I\u2019m worried if every house looks exactly the same it will no longer be as charming. If there are many different layouts of each design to choose from, like how they did it originally then I would completely support it.",
     "Such designs should also be energy efficient and all-electric.",
     "Don't we already have this? Isn't this what The Foothill Catalog is? Maybe I'm not understanding the proposal... I'm in favor of expanding that, if that's what you mean.",
     "Fine, but resources seem better spent in making sure the basic permitting process is reliable, understandable, efficient, affordable and one that builds trust instead of wrecking it. Homeowners trying to do the right thing should not feel like the taxes they pay are being used against them in an Orwellian morass of bureaucratic misfunction. There are many houses that were burned to the ground who's owners might benefit from such pre approved plans as mentioned but what about all the houses that didn't burn but almost did, or burned a little or suffered smoke damage? Those who are trying to make their houses livable again and/or more survivable in future still must navigate the permit process as is.",
     "This is cool if you can do it fast enough and if it would save us money too.",
     "Supportive of having options, but should be somewhat customizable.",
     "It would be insane to build back housing that isn't fire 'safe'. How many times have we all had to evacuate from areas that clearly are not safe to live in?",
     "These designs will need to have a way for architects to make small adjustments for home owners in a manner that does not compromise the goal of fire hardening.",
     "maybe would help.  but only if the designs are appealing and economical to build.",
     "The State has done enough.  Fire-resistant products are fine, but these are the kind of restrictions that nullify \"fast-tracking\".\n\nYou can not expect the Palisades to become some gated community with three house plans.\n\nLet the victims get their plans, \"FAST TRACK\" them past the planning commissions, the Coastal commissions, the environmental impact reviews , the re-building fees, and let these poor people re-build!!!!!",
     "Absolutely support.",
     "Too many lots that are burned are non confirming and so these pre made plans don\u2019t work.",
     "Also for Tiny Houses.  Habitat for Humanity has been using standardized house designs for decades.  Why re we not learning from them?  Is this another instance of house developers blocking the action?  So they can build only more profitable luxury units on land which should be used for low and lower cost housing?",
     "I think this is already happening with the Foothill Catalog and the new Case Study program.",
     "A standardized, pre-approved design would help optimize and speed up recovery efforts. Yes, not everyone will be happy- in fact many people will probably complain. But emphasis should be on building back better, more fire-resistant, safer homes than catering to individual tastes.",
     "I have been in full support of this idea from the beginning -- so long as using these plans is not mandatory for homeowners. If someone wants to go through the process of designing their own structure and having it approved, then should be able to do so. But I think so many people are anxious to get their kids back into a routine -- or get senior loved-ones back into homes -- that pre-approved plans/permits would allow that and also hopefully standardize some of the construction costs so that homeowners using those plans know what the fair pricing is for the rebuild.",
     "How would this help condominium and apartment complexes where some of the buildings have burnt down and others remain standing? Would this catalog actually contain a catalog of ready-to-build plans for condos, townhomes, and apartment buildings? For different lot sizes, shapes, and elevations? Doubtful.",
     "this will help the inexperienced select rebuilding options more quickly and without wasted efforts",
     "Some homeowners may want the option to customize.  How to ensure buildings remain fire resistant?",
     "This seems reasonable.",
     "As long as these designs allow owner aesthetics.",
     "If this is what would help current residents return and it meets their needs.  Also, if there is a cost savings.  Many home owners are under insured.  But this should be a choice, not a mandate.  If a catalog is created, there should be a lot of options. Altadena is not a planned - tract home community",
     "Yes, but fire resistant building can't keep smoke out.",
     "I will be terribly sad if Altadena looks like San Bernardino\u2026",
     "Sounds like the local government needs a hiring spree. They must not have enough personnel.",
     "Yes as long as they fit within the neighborhood aesthetics",
     "Good option to expedite process if you like the design. But would be surprised if they are desirable",
     "I don't know enough about the efficacy of this historically to comment.",
     "This could greatly help rebuilders, especially those with more modest resources.",
     "Need immediately affordable catalogue of plans to build",

     "Yes, part of a total system overhaul after people are back in their homes and their community.",
     "Early detection is critical, but it only works if warnings are actually shared. During the Eaton Canyon fire, we had power, yet no alerts came. No First Watch notification, no evacuation order until police drove by at 1:30am. More monitoring and lookout towers are great, but without a clear, reliable system to get that info to residents in time, it's just more data with nowhere to go. The gap is not just in detection, it\u2019s in communication and action.",
     "These coastal fires have been going on for Centuries.  Why haven't there been stations built prior to this last fire?    Because they will do no good.   Except maybe to burn to the ground.   This Government has a history of incompetent forest management and it also applies to this area where there have been fires for decades....EVERY YEAR.\n\nYou know they are coming.  Get some goats or some common sense scientific solution that prevents these fires from getting out of control.",
     "Emergency communications should not rely on social media platforms.  Also when power outages occur there needs to be other ways to alert communities since they may not have access to television or charged cell phones.",
     "It is likely that the deaths of residents in the Eaton Fire could have been prevented with better warnings and communication.",
     "How about employing competent fire responder chiefs that won't ignore the entire 'other half' of a city just because the bigger homes and mansions are on one side, or just because the epicenter of the fire is in one area, but the winds are blowing toward another?",
     "Already available, so \"neutral.\"  UCSD Alert California cameras are a great example that already exists.  How about a more specific question.",
     "I don't know if this is cost effective. This is a question for firefighter experts.",
     "We HAD aircraft that could have put out the fires... but the winds were too strong for us to fly it.",
     "Need more info to form opinion",
     "Key here being you need to fund for staffing. Also keep in mind \"Alert Fatigue\" - for example I have friends/family in Texas that receive alert notification for everything, including alerts for areas that they are no where near. As a result, they tune out the alerts and or ignore the setting. The alerts need to be geo-located to go out to those most affected.",
     "More- No. We have plenty of citizen and paid fire reporters.",
     "Yes, but -- the majority of what burned in Altadena wasn't in a high-fire risk zone, so not sure this is the exactly solution. We definitely have issues with early warning systems and notifications -- and we MUST figure out how to prioritize evacuating disabled citizens in an emergency. It's devastating to know people were trapped in their homes waiting for help that never came.",
     "What is the point of doing this if we don't hire staff to work on them? Most state agencies are severely under staffed and their pay was just cut. Exactly how is this supposed to work?",
     "Definitely needed",
     "I am strongly supportive of the 2nd part of this--warning systems that operate independently of social media, especially that can be effective at night when people are sleeping.",
     "again 2 statements in one. agree with one. Disagree with other.",
     "Tell the USFS/BLM to get on board first to fund this. How many fires have started on USFS or BLM managed lands?",
     "\u201cIndependent of commercial social media\u201d is important as there is no guarantee that any relevant posts will actually be shown in following people\u2019s feeds.",
     "Yes! Do not assume everyone can get emergency communication through social media.",
     "Increase exit routes, implement regular brush clearance , increase water availability",
     "This could be helpful, but most importantly, there need to be sufficient resources in place in the event of a disaster should such a warning occur. Mandatory resources should, at minimum, include sufficient and well-located water supplies, functional pumps/hydrants/generators, 1st responder personnel & equipment, evacuation plans, and, of course, competent leadership to guide these efforts.",
     "Yes to all this.",
     "The problem with the last fires wasn\u2019t a lack of warning, it was a lack of resources to put out the fires.",
     "Everyone knew which way the fire was moving way before it hit our house. But that didn't help at all when the fire was drawing close to our house. The wind presumably prevented any fire fighting action for our entire neighborhood. We lost 25% of the houses and no fire fighters came to fight the fires. So monitoring the fire with a lot of extra personnel might not be the best use of resources. More fire fighting equipment and better water management might be more useful.",
     "Perhaps Forest towers should be using high tech cameras that can all be monitored in central location",
     "I support it, but who would run it? Who would be responsible for it?\n\nEaton Fire weather guy, Edgar, warned people of \"fire weather winds\" a couple days before the fires. Posted on social media. Saved a bunch of people. \n\nDon't overdue it, just do it right.",
     "YES!  If we had had this we wouldn\u2019t have had the fires",
     "The fire dept should pre deploy to all high risk zones when these anticipated high wind events are coming.",
     "Again, preparedness and planning is essential. California can be a beacon for the rest of the world with innovation in this area. Let's do this!",
     "An early warning system would have helped me to know that there was a fire before it became visible to me.  I evacuated through flames BEFORE any official evacuation warning went out.  If I had known there was a fire nearby, I could have packed some things before running for my life with only my pets in my car.  And obviously this is true for so many others as well.",
     "Agree with comment below about remote monitoring with sensors - I would be supportive of that. But also, Eaton started and spread instantaneously, caused by high winds that did not result in a shut down of high power transmission. Monitoring would not have changed the outcome.",
     "Prob better served to create community awareness. There were some early signs that people just didn't register fully what was happening.",
     "Use modern technology.",
     "More information is always better than less - but this fire wasn't a surprise.  There were cameras, there were spotters, everyone was aware the fire started, right after it started.  The response is more important, and that's where the failures began.",
     "Have to start with no building re-building on fire prine areas.  Zoning first.  Then this suggestion for areas less fire prone.",
     "Of course we need more monitoring and emergency communications. Parts of Altadena never got notified at all, while my family was trapped in the Palisades with the road blocked below and our phones kept blaring at us to evacuate when we couldn't. Not sure about lookout towers though. It seems like residents call pretty fast, and it's that we needed prevention, heat monitoring on the original fire before the winds, more fire fighters, and water available up there. How about a couple more fire stations and some water tanks instead? And can we update the equipment to be what the firefighters need for our area? (Chainsaws, pool pumps, longer hoses, etc) Sure, it's expensive, but the fires cost some of us everything.",
     "A definite YES to more remote monitoring stations. Staffed lookout towers seems like something from a bygone era at this point and something that could easily be replaced by technology (i.e. heat/infrared sensors, etc.). One also has to factor in human error when it comes to lookout towers (e.g. is the staffer paying attention? are their eyes good? etc.), as well as the likely high cost.",
     "Saw a kid that created a drone style monitoring system for forest fires. We should look into that.",
     "This is helpful as long as strategies for response and robust infrastructure for response are available",
     "I supportive of initiatives that are proven effective. I'm not interested measures that sooth people's fears but have little real benefit.",
     "Helpful but we must focus on how to repopulate our homes. Watch duty already does a lot of what is being suggested here. I knew about the fire from Watch Duty and its cameras from UC San Diego before the fire department apparently knew what was happening. That\u2019s a problem that relates to a failure of city/county/state infrastructure. I support augmentation of notification, but if our residents can\u2019t evacuate because of inadequate infrastructure - exit roads, too high residential density in high fire danger zones, inadequate water resources, inadequate fire fighting resources and DEFINITELY inadequate city/county administrative planning for emergencies. This is what caused our tragedy and is what has to be fixed. Social media WORKED!",
     "Senior residents may not have or wish to have social media accts.  Plse don't forget them and people with disabilities.",

     "Use AI",
     "We just need more firefighters!!!",
     "Agree 100%.",
     "We need high tech (currently available!) warning systems at best. At worst, we need at lease sirens warning people to evacuate.",
     "I agree there should be first a daily monitoring of public natural sites in CA , Im thinking public parks in Los Angeles and its area for example : there are known homeless and active agressive population in the Sepulveda bassin and there are still here after a few years for instance , this area should be monitored agressively or restricted .",
     "Early detection is the best approach for wildfire containment. I believe satellite surveillance for heat sources and drones on demand can extinguish many small fires quickly.  City needs to explore and invest R&D into early detection and rapid response. Even a $1M investment in such service, per year, for a location like Temescal Canyon and be a wise investment? Yes of course, if such a service would have saved the Palisades!",
     "I don't know enough about the current infrastructure to know what is needed.",
     "This is a great idea! I would love to see more cameras added to the AlertCalifornia fire system!",

     "A better option would be to go back to way we used to do fire prevention in California- cut in firebreaks/ access roads in high fire areas.",
     "Drones and tech could be good if used properly.",
     "pro: more information, I guess. \ncon: reliant on humans and technology, only provides warning but not response, \nconsiderations: cost, training, staffing, quality assurance, communication, community buy in.",
     "Ask Fire what they need. Give it to them.\n\nNow that NPS fire is down to 65%, funds cut, and FEMA is being disappeared warnings matter.\n\nHowever, studies show that if you warn people too far in advance they ignore warnings and respond less.\n\nWatch Duty did an exceptional job. Their app and their people. They are a non-profit. The UC college cameras are great. I got notices far (days) in advance using Watch Duty and AccuWeather. I didn't have alert issues.\n\nAsk CalFire and the other Fire agencies what would actually help them and then do that. They know what is practical and useful and more than likely they have been asking for it for a decade.\n\nGive Watch Duty a grant. They know what they're doing.",
     "Not needed. We were plenty warned of the major wind event. What is the fire dept doing differently ion order to put a fire like that out? It seems like this fire was caused by the old hot spots from Jan 1. Need the fire dept to be more vigilant about those hotspots.",
     "Unlike hurricanes, earthquakes, etc - fires can be snuffed far more easily the faster fire fighters can get to them.\n\nWe should have fleets of drones ready in each fire risk area of the city to be deployed very quickly to  get closer to the detected fire site, verify the fire and its precise location and begin to extinguish the fire. And then send in a fleet of drones and helicopters, etc  as needed.",
     "I feel our early warning systems are sufficient",
     "Depends on the tech. There are solutions with low cost sensors in trees, and fire extinguishers on automated drones that can get to a hot spot in minutes. These are what need to be adopted. Better sensors in houses can exist too like stoves that automatically shut off if they become too hot. Just get rid of fire places.",
     "Bring the existing network of unmaintained air raid sirens back into service, and add sirens to expand coverage.",

I had paid our insurance for 9 years without a claim when they non renewed us. Getting sone additional support from the community would be a welcomed relief.",
     "Fast-tracks and waivers should have happened withing a month after the fire.",
     "Priority ONE:  No or least building-rebuilding on land marked high risk for fires.\nPriority TWO:  Build more lower and middle class single family homes.\nPriority THREE:  Integrate long term resident who are fire victims into the above priorities.",
     "Time is of essence.  Fast track must mean within days and weeks, no months and years in provision of policies, grants, loans, etc.",
     "The gulf between what insurance is paying and the actual cost to rebuild is crippling.",
     "I'm not a fan of tax waivers but I understand how its beneficial. I believe that this should be tied to a requirement of living in a place for a certain amount of time, like FHA loans.",
     "This should not be limited to how long a resident has lived in a community - all should be eligible. Also, must remove ridiculously inappropriate requirements such as \"cannot have an average household income that exceeds the county average yet also must have a mortgage\". With an average county HH income, you wouldn't be able to afford a mortgage!",
     "I am skeptical that we can equitably assess how \"deep\" someone's community roots are. I think there are plenty of people who have been in a place for a long time but are not integrated in the community and are not truly in need of assistance. I am unwilling to support this without a clearer sense of how this will be judged.",
     "Long term residents should be supported to return home.",
     "Need clearer definitions of the terms above. Long-term community residents?  Appreciate the fast-tracked recovery grant and 3-yr property tax waiver proposals, but those ought to be made available to all those trying their best to rebuild like-for-like, regardless whether they arrived 5 years ago or 50 years ago.",
     "What was the rental rate in the neighborhood?  What were the income levels?   Blanket tax breaks for the rich again?   Again big question little information. This survey is beginning to look like there is an agenda with a plan in place.",
     "Yes based on need.",
     "So many long term families live here that are the building blocks of the community and live in legacy homes for decades. These homes can not be rebuilt for fair plan dollars and our Palisades history will disappear. There odd a lot of new wealth that has entered the community and they can easily rebuild and can afford unadmitted carrier luxury insurance. This is a turning point for the community.",
     "Yes, people who have owned for a long time may not have the insurance coverage to rebuild the structure, let alone what they lost.",
     "I think anything that prioritizes individuals and families over corporations is important here. These fires are either the best thing that ever happened to wealthy opportunists and BlackRock, or they are our chance to push individuals and organizations like them out of our communities.",
     "Need immediate financial resources to rebuild",
     "I suspect hard to get this passed",

     "Direct support to all impacted residents has greatest impact.",
     "Grants will be miss used and miss issued. I think we need to offer tax waivers as well as catastrophic tax deductions for 2025.  Grants should only be used for those in need based on a very detailed qualifications list and from my experience in loosing out on a business grant because the questionnaire was vague is a perfect example of grants not going to those in real need",
     "Returning property owners should be given priority over new owners in granting building permits. New property owners should have to wait while returning owners re-build. New owners should not be given the advantages fire re-builders are given with respect to permits, plan check, inspections, etc",

     "Need more programs for those that are underinsured but are not low income.",
     "Must be need-based.",
     "Equity is important in administering this program.",
     "This should be within reason. Financial assistance should be granted on the basis that people who rebuild in very high fire severity zones are doing it to code. The fire risk is also the burden of those who live in these areas. This should also be granted based on specific factors such as income level, senior status, mortgages/loans, and other necessary factors (aka how other tax exemptions are usually determined). Local government needs taxes to maintain essential fire management/utility services. If you don't pay taxes, don't expect local fire jurisdictions save your home from future fires.",
     "Good idea but how can we afford it? How do you define long term? I'd say 10+ years.",

     "Targeted financial relief for long-term residents makes sense as we're already bracing for higher property taxes after losing everything. But any program like this must include safeguards to prevent abuse. How do we define \u201clong-term,\u201d and who verifies it? Many of us are committed to rebuilding and staying, but fairness and transparency are key. Without it, well-meaning programs risk creating resentment or being exploited.",
     "It is very difficult for long time residents to rebuild.",
     "Yes, as it appears this destruction was caused by Government incompetence, all grants and property tax waivers should be available.  \n\nEvery fire victim should be a priority over any other City approvals.  (The presumed definition of \"fast-track\")\n\nAll victims should have access to home owner insurance and there should be absolutely no 'targeting', which infers a tiered system for assistance.",

     "To be able to say in 5 years \"everyone who wanted to return was able to return\" would be the ultimate goal. We've already fallen short of that, but I'm in favor of any well thought through, well organized, well managed initiatives that get us as close to that goal as possible.",
     "Terms used in this suggestion are vague. What does \"long-term\" mean? What are \"deep community roots\"? This appeals to emotions but lacks rational specificity",
     "There has been many government assistance at a Federal, State, County, City and charity level.  More assistance needs to be reviewed with what is already being done to see if it makes sense and is not just another program.",
     "Yes, and we need to do more. For many people who want to rebuild, this is not enough to make it viable. Also need to support businesses to reopen to make the community livable faster. I'm speaking specifically about Altadena.",
     "Wonderful intent but impossible implementation",
     "It should be income-qualified.",
     "I think the same financial assistance should be available to all affected community members.",
     "Strongly support this.  It was infuriating to find out that LA County spent its FireAid funds on murals and playgrounds when people need financial help getting back on their feet.  We need to support those that have been here for generations.",
     "Not a well thought out question with too many pre determined outcomes assumed as possible and fact.",
     "Define long-term. Define deep community roots. Too vague.",
     "I need to see how you're defining \"long-term.\" People who have chosen to make Altadena their home and backed this decision by buying a home there do not deserve to be deprioritized just because someone else has been there longer. In many cases, the newer residents have more at stake because they are likely to have paid multiple times as much for their homes, and more likely to have large mortgages still outstanding.",
     "property tax relief is very much desired. We've lost enough. Give us a break for a few years while we rebuild",

     "Not sure more staff would help.  Best to ask existing staff what the problems and ask people trying to build.",
     "Isn't this the idea behind the One Stop Rebuilding Center already in place? The problem seems to be that not every agency is represented regularly (e.g. LADWP), nor are any singular individuals informed to answer questions beyond their own narrow scope of focus, so it's not very feasible to get comprehensive responses easily. Still, better than nothing or having to go all the way to DTLA!",

     "This seems reasonable.",
     "Shouldn't this exist as a county service for anyone? Is this question just about increasing the staff? That's clearly needed given the volume.",
     "This is absolutely needed. My limited experience with building permits was stressful and complicated and it was for fairly simple projects. Trying to rebuild or repair an entire home post-fire feels daunting enough without having to navigate this process on your own.",

     "YES - and do the same for geotechnical requirements.  This is where everything will slow to a halt.\n\nAlready the state has large geotechnical firms on retainer, and it's not in their interest to move these things quickly - they are making people jump through flaming hoops to rebuild homes on stable lots because there MIGHT be a landslide some day in the future, or there WAS a landslide many many years ago, or there COULD be some movement in the soil 300 feet below.  If there was a house there before, let people build a new house +10%.  End of story.",
     "This is much needed!",
     "Is this feasible with strains on county and city budgets and the reduced workforce? Staff are overburdened already and departments in planning and building & safety etc. are not on the same page. Unless local government wants to pay for overtime, then there should be key considerations for government restructuring to allow for teams to continue this work full time. There needs to be clear guidance for management to create more efficient assistance (rather than making residents go back and forth for days/weeks) before these teams are established. Accountability and transparency are the key issues here. Another option is purchase AI software to streamline these permitting processes at least for the basics.",
     "There should be a single cooperative agency managing the Balkanized mass of 20 different agencies offering support. The support centers were just like a Kafka nightmare of bureaucratic, idiocy and lack of coordination.\n\nIt was embarrassing to see how poorly executed and organized this was and what a great hassle they put every person who lost property, business, or work",
     "Various people at the permit office are misinformed or ignorant about fire resistant materials, assemblies and principles, title 24 energy requirements, the ins and outs of the inspection process including whether a plan check and engineering analysis is or is not needed. There is a serious lack of understanding among some at the office about homeowners ability to afford rebuilding and retrofitting after the fire and no ability to help homeowners navigate the process. Most importantly, there is not a single person who seems to have final say and authority, you get different answers from different people, the result is extra costs, angry contractors, doubt, confusion, delays and frustration in rebuilding and fire hardening.",

     "only if you can provide enough staffing so it can be accessed quickly (appointments within 5 business days or less of the request)",

     "Yes, please.",
     "I'm supportive, but so disillusioned right now. Why is the process so bad that we need triage centers?! Where is the money coming from? I feel like you need to just give us all the funding from programs like this. Then it can make a difference by actually allowing us to rebuild in the first place?",
     "The resource that would be most helpful to me right now is a case worker who knows me and my situation and can provide resources and guidance. Ideally, this person could act as a liaison with insurance, my mortgage company, my contractor/architect, LA county permitting, and nonprofit organizations that are providing grants and other sources of funding. Rebuilding is a full time job that I cannot do without help.",
     "Yes. Assist fire victims negotiating the permitting process.",
     "I think this is needed, otherwise you have 6,000+ projects all trying to figure it out",
     "I assume the state or county would take responsibility?  How can we reduce redundancy?",

     "better to spend staff time on streamlining the approvals and permitting process to enable.",
     "The permitting decision process takes much longer than what this priority suggests. This already exists to some degree and has not been found useful to most of my neighbors",
     "Don't we already have this. Isn't that what the \"one stop permitting\" center is? Maybe I'm not understanding the proposal...",
     "Great!  Making the process simpler and using technology should be done county wide as nobody thinks the current state of the processes is good.",
     "What about the 3 day fast tracking? The wait periods for grading, an requirement to notify non existent neighboring homes is a joke.",
     "Pros: convenience, humanity\ncons: none that I can think of.\nconsiderations: opening hours, prioritization, languages, accessibility, scaled support depending on familiarity (contractor vs novice homeowner).\nQuestion: what would dedicated staff do when not at triage centers? What would be deprioritized, or how would they get up to speed if contracted for role?",
     "Need dedicated staff that are knowledgeable otherwise it just another layer that will add to delays",
     "This could be great or useless depending on how it is done.",
     "Pasadena and maybe LA also already have young Parks and Recreation hires who could be trained to support resident victims navigate the front end of the rebuilding burocracy.  Review of blueprints would be another different, higher level of expertise.",
     "Would these specialized teams have experience in permitting for condominiums, townhomes, mobile homes, and apartment buildings?",
     "I'd  be first in line to take advantage of that type of service. I think it could be very helpful.",
     "Since natural disasters are here to stay, why not set up a good website intake and have that updated regularly, then have triage people on hand to intake residents, like a social worker might, and accompany them through the process.",
     "This is exactly the kind of help homeowners need, and exactly what government should be doing.",
     "Without better house design this is pointless.\nSo get better at house design. Not simple,\nbut technically and economically doable.",
     "Include apartments, mobile homes, condos and townhomes",
     "Incredibly important for those dealing with homes in the VHFHZ and hillside ordinance properties",
     "Definitely a worthwhile investment since most building departments already struggle with a backlog of permit reviews before a major disaster.",

     "Is it possible to use AI for this purpose?",
     "So long as they are there to helping build and less to be a gatekeeper",
     "no need for more bureaucracy. This has happened to countless communities. Ask them to share their findings in a basic Wikipedia type setting and do not pay someone $4300k per year with full pension to 'manage' that...the knowledge is no longer secretive. It simply needs to be centralized and shared.",
     "Focused efforts are needed. Again, what happened to the FireAid donations",
     "Yeah, and also: how about we make permitting processes less arcane? It's like our tax system \u2014\u00a0it doesn't have to be this hard!",
     "If and only if these people are truly there to navigate the system, solve problems and meet fire victims at their specific level of need. No more civil servants who shrug while acting as roadblocks.",
     "Absolutely yes! That would speed up the process and ensure that things were done correctly, both by the residents and the agencies.",
     "This is a great idea! This should be conducted through an Office of a Ombudsperson.",
     "More competent staff with problem solving skills needed.",
     "Due diligence requires many agencies to review plans.  One or more centralized agency may or may not be the answer, especially with current electronic technology.   Recommend serious efficiency study to streamline the process instead of current PROPOSED SB as the solution.",
     "Would be a welcomed resource and a time saver for people. It would also help residents from feeling overwhelmed",
     "CA is one of the richest state in the world before Japan I believe why is there a need to create ? There should be a mandatory fire fund in place , which is a part of tax money that we paid or that those wealthy companies pay.",

     "I don't want to support rebuilding in an area that is prone to burning and shouldn't be inhabited in the first place.",

     "A catalog of financial support programs already exists in various forms, and many of us have spent countless hours navigating them. Unless this directory offers truly new resources or significantly streamlines access, it risks being just another list. What survivors need most is actual funding, clear guidance, and advocates who can help cut through red tape, not more directories to sort through on our own.",
     "Please collaborate with others who are already working on this and not duplicate efforts, which ultimately causes confusion for survivors.",
     "Needs to a user-friendly portal.  Also available to those w/o digital connection via real person navigator services.",
     "Wealth thresholds should be considered. I don't think we should give handouts to ultra wealthy individuals.",
     "This sounds like a good resource but one that could easily overwhelm a traumatized person. Even better would be to have ombudsmen/neutral advisors available who could help residents sort through their options and navigate requirements.",
     "This is a needed resource, and it should be done in such a way that approvals and payments can be done within hours/days. We are mired in enough paperwork as it is and going through a lengthy approval and disbursement process might add frustration.",
     "When they check for fraud in detail, everyone's yelling about how money isn't going out fast enough... when they push out money fast, everyone yells about fraud. What a catch-22!",
     "Financial support programs should not be so fragmented. They need to work together so disaster victims don't have to jump through so many in hoops, often providing the same information, just to be turned down for assistance because they had some insurance or they earn more than the county average household income.",
     "Need financial assistance immediately, like grants,  not loans",
     "This makes basic sense. No good reason not to do this.",
     "Financial support and resources is most needed to rebuild.",
     "This can be best done by free market. Government has already proven is helplessness in their civic responsibility to residents.",
     "If they are programs that actual help victims of the fire and not every other non profit under the sun in the County of Los Angeles.",
     "People impacted by the LA fires need a central navigational application to support them on financial support, rebuilding, legal and other needs. It needs to be a simple interface that can be used by people of various technical abilities.",
     "There would need to be transparency with this to assure residents that their best interests are being kept in mind and that they're not being funneled to \"sponsored\" organizations.",
     "These groups need to help them be prepared. The county has completely lost focus on this happening again.",
     "We need programs that are funded first , then we can catalogue them. Step one before step two.",
     "Just make a good website.",
     "Does this not already exist?!?",
     "As far as I know, for many aid programs, including SBA loans, the problem isn't people not knowing about them. It's actually having the programs executed and the grants or loans funded. Also immediately after the fire there were too many things for people to apply for, and each one promising only a small amount, at a moment when people had no time or energy to fill in so many different applications. More important that aid is administered through a small number of programs that can deliver meaningful help without too much required on the part of the disaster victims. Or to centralize the application process so victims could register in one place (FEMA?) and be considered for everything they are eligible for based on that one application.",
     "There is already a glut of information coming from a plethora of sources. Not sure how you would centralize this effectively and weed out the redundancies",
     "Heck yes!!  This disaster was due to incompetent Government.   Create all the funds the State can provide while residents form a class-action suit to fill in the gaps.",
     "Seems obvious.  It's the least we can do.",
     "Devil is in the details.",
     "Cataloging available resources is fine.",
     "There was a mad dash in the beginning to gather support services - especially the basics like food, medicine, clothing, shelter. The faster this is coordinated the better for future disasters.",
     "In addition to supporting our seniors and low income families who lost their homes, please don't forget about regular families who lost everything, meaning middle class households too.",
     "needs based, only.",

     "Isn't this VOAD?",
     "This is the beauty of the internet and AI.  Prefer not to have government do this.",
     "Not knowing what changes are coming with FEMA in the Trump Administration, this should be carefully considered.  If FEMA continues to provide financial assistance directly to families, this + Small Business Administration loans are the first line of support for disaster survivors.  A useful add on would be to train community based organizations to help disaster survivors understand and access these programs - the process can be confusing.",
     "Doing so, but only in full transparency, disclosing all direct & indirect financial interests those organizations have to political or corporate (private & public) individuals and organizations",
     "Loans just make the financial gulf worse.  Grants are the only way to get us back in our houses without being crippled by debt.",
     "This is a great idea! I would also encourage this to be virtual as well! And if this can be implemented with Artificial Assistance this would be a great idea (i.e. online quiz that then identifies what assistance can be utilized)",
     "In theory, yes, this is a great idea, but in practice these things are often not well managed logistically. If done well, I think this could be a very helpful resource.",
     "I support this idea, but hasn't it been done already? Sure, it would be great to have 1 or 2 reputable, regularly updated sites that contain up to date information and links to grants, loans and aid.\n\nLA County should have something on their Recovery website. Maybe it's fine as is and just needs to be pushed out to the community via different platforms.",
     "Encourage alternate non electronic means of application, i.e. telephone conversations, ol FC fashion mail and/or local in person.  As survivor, it requires extra effort to get documentation, access to scanner, etc.",
     "Making resources available and known is great.",
     "This seems to me to be the very reason for government \u2014 to help impacted community members connect with the resources they need to recover. If we aren\u2019t supporting each other with information on existing resources, are we even a community?",
     "This should be part of 211 LA and the LA County Recovers website",
     "Would be more helpful if it were a nonprofit group that compiled the list. This would help prevent fear of \"govt tracking\" if following the links.",
     "With the diffusion of AI-tools, I would even recommend integrating a tool to assist residents with sifting through the directory of resources based on prioritized need for residents. This way the directory doesn't become an overwhelming list of links and other reports or forms the community members have to sit with for a long time. But I agree with others, that in-person assistance is better at times and if another organization already does this, no need to reinvent the wheel.",
     "Sure... If you can account for the money. Seems California keeps losing our tax dollars with no accountability",
     "Yes 100%",
     "Let's make it easier for people to get the resources available.",
     "This seems reasonable.",
     "Absolutely. A giant database is too much -- we need real live humans who are working with us directly, asking us about our needs, and finding the programs, resources, and funding to help.",
     "I'm supportive.. I've just also given up on any of this applying to me or my neighbors. Which is wild, because I'm from a very middle class neighborhood for the Palisades, full of elderly people. You'd think we'd qualify for something. Does losing our home of nearly 50 years not count?",
     "Electronic app version to keep updated.\n\nIt would be helpful if bulletpoints of qualifications/limits were posted too, to avoid wasting time. Often you don't find that out until you're through applying.\n\nInclude funeral and legal resources/hotlines would help. \n\nClear citing of laws about who is responsible for doing what after a fire (i.e. landlords paying for ash, smoke, water, fire cleanup) would help too.\n\nEncourage people to contact utility, cc, other companies they deal with to ask for help.\n\nAs well as help with receiving mail. Mail for legal, financial, or state/fed assistance triples after a disaster but is marked \"do not forward.\" How ridiculous. It's a natural disaster we have to be able to forward mail.",
     "I'm also very weary of anything actually happening - a catalog of programs really means nothing - it's more work for everyone to chase down a possible check that likely won't cover one mortgage payment.  Either get in with 2 feet and support the residents or get out of the way.",
     "The government failed the Palisades survivors. Virtually no one has gotten more than $770 from FEMA, proceeds from fire aid concerts intended for victims were mis-directed by the Annenburg Foundation. Only private institutions (e.g., American Red Cross) came through for us.",
     "Si, se necesita ayuda. We need the help.",
     "Trusted by WHOM????\nCreate a comprehensive catalog of financial support programs and organizations available to help with rebuilding efforts. This directory would connect fire-affected residents with grants, loans, and aid programs, WITHOUT the partnership. Too much loss , unaccounted for missing funds, not getting into the hands of survivors... How do you mesure Trusted?",
     "If a truly comprehensive resource could be created, this would be helpful, but I'm doubtful. There are so many links and so many poorly-described aid programs for which 99% of people are not eligible that it's practically impossible to navigate effectively, especially for programs with tight deadlines.",
     "There needs to be a structure put in place for accountability - perhaps a citizen advisory board with locals to ensure that dollars are going to those with the most critical situations.",
     "Agree, needs based only.",
     "First get the incentives correct.  Carbon economics applies everywhere.  LA is the natural financial center of the carbon economy.  You can also share with the rest of us new ways of making  the shift that work for the people most exposed to the downside of the transition to the carbon economy. \n\nWe're California.  We made this beautiful mess, and we're addressing the polycrisis together.\n\nGo Bears!",

Several of the programs have been very helpful in providing some funds to replace some of our more basic needs after we lost almost everything in the fire.   But funds to rebuild our home have been woefully underwhelming. Granted it going to take a significant amount of money to rebuild,  but we feel like we're on an island adrift right now.

I spent much of my time on the firewatch app which is a private app, and many announcements went out on twitter. There should be municipal or state run communication systems.

When a repair needs to happen time it appropriately, i.e. drain the reservoir after fire season BUT BEFORE that even happens, contractors to bid the job are lined up with a plan to repair before start of next fire season. If selected contractor is unable to complete the job in a timely manner leadership team should quickly pivot to next in line.",

     "We had no water in the Palisades fire and my home burned down the following day. This is a travesty.",
     "There was no water when my lifelong home burned. It was not during the initial windstorm. Nobody was there because the reservoir and hydrants were dry.",
     "The hydrants were not the issue, we had plenty of hydrants in our neighborhoods.  But if there's no supply, a million hydrants won't help.  The empty reservoir is clearly a massive failure, but there should also be automatic water shutoffs for homes, similar to a gas shutoff for earthquakes, in the event of a fire.  The more homes burned, the more water was lost to the pipes opening up - that should not happen.",

     "Probably would require an upgrade of water main lines- could be combined with additional underground utility work if coordinated correctly.",
     "Similar to the question about burying power lines, it's not about the necessity for doing so - that's obvious. The question is about how effectively agencies can follow through on these goals and how much more money is it going to cost taxpayers beyond the billions already appropriated for similar goals.",
     "I strongly support the merit of the idea presented here; however, implementation is a different question.",
     "Just let the water flow (and be stored in reservoirs) where it's needed instead of discarding out to sea.",
     "Let's begin with making sure to check the hydrants on a regular basis, which was not done, and ensuring there is water flowing to the ones in place. Address and acknowledge the lack of accountability and oversight that was neglected before proposing improvements.",
     "Not at the expense of homeowners. Already have to pay a $400 fee to my water company for a \u201cWill Serve\u201d letter to get permits when my water was never turned off at my property and my water was not available during the fire.",
     "Of course.  Updated systems save lives.",
     "No new dams. Stop bleeding a stone. We have less water than we allocate.",
     "Absolutely, this lack of updates and old fire hydrants that weren\u2019t working or with no water pressure is what lead to the catastrophic losses in the Palisades",
     "If there's no water in the reservoirs, what's the point of this?",
     "This is something that should be left to the fire experts. I don't know to what extent this matters.",
     "Long overdue",
     "Only do this in areas that are already more safe to re-build. I don't want to put infrastructure in areas that shouldn't be inhabited in the first place.",
     "I'm in favor of this but the cost should not impact the homeowners",
     "do i really need to explain why this is a good idea?",
     "Working hydrants could have stopped billions of costs and saved lives.  This is a no-brainer",
     "Yes. Any chance we have to improve built in infrastructure now is the time do it. Water pipes in the LA area are sometimes 100 years old. Good way to start on a clean slate",
     "There was probably a good reason that it wasn't filled. Government agency staff can't just \"snap their fingers\" and solve every problem. We deserve a full accounting of what happened, but we should also be understanding that these are systemic failures and not just one person being bad at their job. (If only the real world were so simple that every problem could be blamed on one person!)",
     "It is clear that we simply did not have enough water or fire engines for the massive fires in January. Usually for a single home on fire, two to three engines are required. If you have 1,000 homes on fire, you need more than 3,000 fire engines. We must retrofit homes to be more fire resistant. We should also promote more water efficiency, water recycling and water capture. Although there are some water incentives from Metropolitan Water District, the vast majority of residents are unaware. Plus receiving the rebates is very tricky too.",
     "The waterlines are in need of upgrades, so this would be a good idea for both regular usage and for firefighters",
     "This will not save us if we have freakishly powerful Santa Ana winds like Jan 7. Will ratepayers who do not live in high fire severity zones have to front the cost for this?",
     "I think using ocean water to put out fires is a good idea, but I don't think you would need to filter it.  I believe you can use it as is to put out a fire.  Unless your referring to filtering out any possible fish or seaweed, but thinking there's probably a simple fix for that.  we are so close to the ocean, just wish there was a way to utilize it as a resource in an emergency - so good idea!",
     "Are there any rainwater collection solutions that could help these efforts (whether to source the fire hydrants and/or offer water solutions on properties)?",
     "Duh...and the water companies should be required to show compliance annually.",
     "Needs to be an integrated, failsafe system and include removal and replacement of all materials that have health impacts.",
     "Upgrading systems is vital, but if there are no firefighters on the ground to use the water or protect homes, those upgrades mean very little. Many of us had defensible space and working hydrants, but nobody showed up. Technology alone can't replace a coordinated, timely human response. We need commitments to staffing and boots on the ground when it counts.",
     "As we have heard from previous fire areas, there is not ever enough water to support fire suppression in ALL zones when the winds are high. This would be difficult to bring to fruition.",
     "question is vague",
     "It\u2019s a good start but we need to be sure there is access to enough water so the hydrants don\u2019t run dry from a massive simultaneous usage that happens during a fire.",
     "I believed a major factor of the palisades fire destructive results was directly related to miss management of our water resources. Two major water sources were empty prior to the fire for maintenance.   It was ridiculous doing repairs to reservoirs during the height of fire season. Those repairs should have been done in the winter when fire risk was significantly reduced. Our house was destroyed in Malibu as a direct result of the fire department not being able to extinguishing the palisades fire prior to it reaching Malibu. Poor water management and not utilizing the fire departments resources was a much to blame as the high winds for the destruction of Malibu homes and businesses after the fire wasn't controlled in palisades.",
     "Pro: seems obvious. \nCon: doesnt address hurricane wind driven conflagrations alone. \nConsiderations: would this impact insurance prices?",
     "Obviously",
     "I still don\u2019t understand why the Santa Ynez reservoir was not fixed and why the head of LADWP still has a job there",
     "Lack of water was a major contributor to our community burning down",
     "our infrastructure is aging and needs better attention than our political leaders have given it.",
     "You mean what was supposed with our tax dollars and DIDN'T??",
     "no one should lose a home due to no water pressure",
     "these are such obvious questions. I cant imagine this survey is going to change anything, sorry",
     "I think this would be great -- but given the issues LA County has with water as a whole, is it feasible? We have consistent water main breaks due to age and disrepair. How much money and time would it require to upgrade our systems? That feels like a much longer-term project when we have such immediate need in two major communities.",
     "To start, regular maintenance on existing capabilities would help, e.g. filled reservoirs, working fire hydrants.",
     "This is obvious. We need an infrastructure that can support a fire in the future. We were already failed once, this is detrimental.",
     "The Santa Ynez reservoir was constructed in the 1960\u2019s for the purposes of fire protection. We can build, construct, upgrade and everything else to improve our water system, but unless we have an effective administrative structure to manage these resources, they will continue to fail us. LADWP has informed us that the reservoir is back in service. But they STILL have not fully refilled it. So we are STILL in the same situation with inadequate water resources available if a fire breaks out tomorrow. And LAFD did not act on the fact that it did not have enough water resources to fight a fire in the Palisades then, and they are not publicly commenting that they are only in a slightly better position today. Administration has failed us.",
     "Need to find a way for every fire truck to have portable pool pumps. Lots of full pools and burned down homes\u2026.",
     "While more resilient water systems are important, the reality is that the fire was moving too quickly. No amount of water or firefighters would have stopped those flames. I believe a better solution would be to assign all emergency personnel to evacuating people.",
     "Agree 100%",
     "Yes, of course. This should be done asap across CA.",
     "Sure.  This is a great idea.  I hope somewhere in this deliberation we talk about what we do about what is causing this increase in fires - human induced climate change.",
     "Strongly supportive, but where are the funds coming from for this?",
     "Well yes good plan, overall.\n\nAnd it wouldn't have mattered here. \n\nThe fire was MASSIVE and FAST. Almost the largest Natural Disaster ever I believe. There is never going to be \"enough\" water in a flow system to be able to put out rapidly spreading fire in 100 mph winds in ultra dry conditions in a heavily populated areas. \n\nPalisades fire went from 10 to 200 acres in the first 20 minutes. The firefighters couldn't even get there yet Winds were fierce and the fire by all reports was not \"behaving normally.\" So no matter how much water was in the system... fire in those conditions is going to be vicious.\n\nI had tons of alerts for days beforehand.\n\nYes, make firefighting as easy as possible, but that's not going to matter in those conditions",
     "Absolutely essential.  Adequate pressure for fire suppression will be a requirement for rebuilding.",
     "The state would need to become a power broker to push the local mutual water companies to merge for the community's own good. \nLas Flores is hurting, the other two are doing better. \nThere's a power struggle between them. Water is this generation's gold.",
     "We need to prevent fires from starting as much as possible",
     "This should be done in ALL high fire zones!!",
     "Just seeing power lines causes me PTSD from the night we had to evacuate. Because of the strong winds Altadena experiences on an annual basis, I believe this should be a safety requirement.",
     "Increase value of properties over time.",
     "High up front cost, but beneficial in the long term and will help prevent power outages in high wind events.",
     "If they don't do this, shame on them.  Asking for more problems down the line.",
     "This should be a major priority.",
     "only if it is at no cost to the homeowner and done with full transparency and information.",
     "Yes, and Edison should pay for it.",
     "Pros: reduced risk of fire, reduces visual blight of powerpoles. Allows trees to grow naturally and not being hacked to accommodate wires, \nCons: cost, road and infrastructure damage while undergrounding. \nConsiderations: undergrounding of internet lines too, who pays for this process, timing and timeline, easement access to put equipment are unclear.",
     "Yes, this is very important to do in all newly developed areas, high risk fires areas & areas that are being re-built due to fire loss. Those should be the priority \"build underground as you go\" areas, then from there prioritize add'l areas based on fire risk. The rate payers def. should not have to bare the cost of this either. I'm in PG&Es area & the PUC has approved several rate hikes to cover these upgrade costs & its literally putting small companies out of business & people in the red. PG&E & the other utility Co's. make enough money to pay for this cost on their own! Their CEO's, stakeholders & high paid employees can take pay cuts & stop getting raises to pay for this. Its their fault for not maintaining their grid, not ours.",
     "While this would remove one ignition source, I do believe that the better option would be to utilize solar panels. This would eliminate the need for power lines.",
     "Interesting as the fire started at the transmission tower in the canyon vs. overhead electrical wires. We were at the mercy of the winds after that.",
     "Let free market balance above-ground v. below ground needs, including costs of their poor choices.",

     "Yes, please!",
     "I think the answer to this question may be one of the most unanimous among any question being asked of the millions of people who were affected/indirectly-affected/not affected at all by the LA wildfires- BURY THE POWER LINES WHEREVER POSSIBLE.",
     "This is clearly needed on the distribution system. It is the only solution that will enable reilability as well. We can't just have utilities keep turning the lights off for days and weeks at a time. Undergrounding is expensive, but so are utility sparked wildfires. Additionally, regular brush clearance 50 ft around transmission lines in high fire threat areas and replacing old transmission lines in these areas (e.g. after 40 years) is probably needed to avoid another Eaton (or Camp or any of the other conflagrations sparked by aging transmission equipment).",
     "Buried lines are critical to preventing future disasters",
     "Burying utilities while expensive up front and at times more expensive to maintain vs. overhead, it is definitely worth doing when sufficient funding is available.  FEMA may pay for these upgrades subject to a cost/benefit analysis.",
     "By all means, underground and do it all at once with other infrastructure that needs to be replaced (water, sewage, stormdrain, communications). If possible, a micro-grid installation that serves the community and backs up power outages should be installed.",
     "This is something that should be left to the fire experts, but my understanding is that this is correct, power lines are causing many of the fires.",
     "Paid for by the government, not residents, I should hope.",
     "Duh.  Edison has been urged to do this for decades, and has always used deflection as their response.",
     "Only in high fire severity zones where it makes the most sense (i.e. dense forest growth, hillsides with a lot of brush). Otherwise it will take too long / too expensive for ratepayers across the state. The burden should be on utility companies, not residents. How long has it taken/how expensive has it been PG&E to underground even 1 mile of power lines?",
     "In the North East, natural gas utility companies are required to excavate and replace old and dangerous cast iron gas lines. Old power lines in fire zones should be treated the same way. We should not be letting the utility companies off the hook to never update their infrastructure. Since there is no profit motive to do so, the only way forward is through regulating them to do this. Utility payers shouldn't be penalized for utility company negligence.",
     "Agree, but there should be no cost to the homeowner to do this.",
     "Thank you very much for starting in this initiative already. Please expand its reach. Wonderful long-term action!",
     "As long as this can be done without adding expense to rate payers.  Private power companies like PGE and So Cal Edison should completely cover this cost with existing profits.",
     "Yes it is imperative to bury the electrical lines. It will be expensive but not nearly as expensive (or destructive) as the fires caused by power lines.",
     "Power companies have been sides stepping this option for years and it has cost Californians billions of dollars in property losses and hundreds of lost lives. Enough is enough put the power lines underground. Utility companies have been responsible for 7 of 10 of the biggest fires in California history. Aesthetically it would be a tremendous improvement to the beautification of California too",
     "Great if affordable but I believe burying  power lines is expensive.",
     "Also reduce overhead lighting and the color temperature of any lighting installed. This should be a \"dark sky\" neighborhood, in keeping with its rural character.",
     "Buried power lines should absolutely be a priority -- we have the worries in wildfires and in earthquakes -- and this would be an important step forward in helping protect neighborhoods from compounded tragedy in natural disasters.",
     "Mandatory. Edison needs to get its infrastructure out of the late 19th century.",
     "So long as it does not delay the rebuilding of homes.  This kind of project would have these homes build in 2040!!",
     "Define whenever possible - when does the cost become too much?",
     "We live in a zone in Pasadena that has power lines underground. Tbh, with the high winds we experienced, I think it would be wise to invest in this. We believe our neighborhood survived because of this.",
     "I don't know how this works with earthquakes, since LA is on a fault line and after an earthquake fire is the main concern so that issue matters. But it does seem most of our fires start from power line sparks in wind.\n\nIn terms of wind events especially in areas that are on hilltops or have a history of getting stronger gusts, yes definitely bury as much as possible.\n\nUpdating equipment is important. Moving towards renewable energy as much as possible.",
     "Costs benefits ratios necessary.  Very quick response to an ignition might be as effective but cheaper. Distance from urban areas is also a consideration. Some fires periodically should be allowed in this historic \"land of smokes\". ..Procedures already in place under \"fire management\" may just need review.",
     "Essential for ongoing safety",
     "In our neighborhood we already have underground utilities. We support more of Pacific Palisades moving in that direction especially while streets are being torn up and repaved.",
     "I would encourage the state to ensure that the privatized power companies do not waste/fraud their way out of doing this or return the funds to share holders as opposed to actually performing the maintenance or line burying when given state funds",
     "I initial reaction is \"Yes!\" but I'd like to understand this issue better. I've been hearing that it's much more complicated than I previously understood and could cost homeowners money, along with some other issues I'd like explained better.",
     "SCE already has a program in place to bury or armor gridl equipment.",
     "of course",
     "I agree.  My hesitation is cost and if that cost would be past on to us as residence.",
     "And make sure that when lines are going to be buried that electric utilities invite and coordinate with low volt line users to also bury cable, fiber optic, and cellular lines. In Topanga they didn\u2019t\u2026 so after spending millions to underground electric lines we still have chopped off poles with low volt lines everywhere.",
     "Whether it's power lines starting the fires or falling and preventing the first responders from entering a neighborhood, they should all be underground.  We know now that DWP didn't de-energize the lines in either Altadena or Palisades, it's a massive safety concern.",
     "I support this though know that rates will go up as a result. Mitigation strategies to prevent ignition like what happened with Eaton Fire seem like a no brainer and bear no additional cost, just the shut down of transmission lines.",
     "We should learn the lessons from Lahaina. High winds forecast should trigger mandatory power cutoffs in high risk areas. Residents should be responsible to have own backup generators",
     "Most important issue so far. Why rebuild third world technology. So much safer and more beautiful underground.",
     "Absolutely. This shouldn't even be up for discussion. Please just make it happen and make sure negligent utilities companies foot the bill.",
     "HIGHEST PRIORITY! 100% support the undergrounding of all power and communication lines. It is essential that the Communication companies agree to underground their lines as well. This needs to happen NOW, while the streets are torn up, especially in those neighborhoods where many homes were lost. Get those crews into the Palisades NOW before we are rebuilding. All of this can get paid through RULE 20D, which was utilized in San Diego.",
     "How many bills have already been passed, how many tax dollars and bond dollars have already been appropriated to handle this? The issue seems to be non-compliance, so the focus should be mandating timelines and associated penalties for public/private agencies such as PG&E, LADWP, SoCal Edison, etc. to execute rather than squandering public money elsewhere on their balance sheets.",
     "Electrical system and polls in the city are outdated , they should have been updated long time ago .",
     "Yes, yes and yes. Finally needs to happen. The longer we wait the more expensive it's going to get. Get this done now and avoid future fires being impacted by power lines.",
     "Instead of more expensive infrastructure, we should be investing in more Distributed Energy Resources and Virtual Power Plants. Undergrounding power lines may be necessary in some cases, but it's more important to look at resiliency and resource adequacy. Just because the utilities and investors make huge profits investing in transmission lines and undergrounding lines doesn't mean that such projects are either needed or what is best for ratepayers, affordability, the grid or resiliency.",
     "This is long overdue and much needed!",
     "Again, yes, yes, yes! It's expensive but it's the most important things we can do. Some of those power company executives and shareholders can cut back on their pay packets and dividends. This should be mandated if you wish to operate in California.",
     "Well duh. No brainer. Requires telecoms to do it also.",
     "Don't have power lines. Use solar panels and wind turbines locally on each building. Make buildings to passive house specs. Deny building permits for any new buildings that aren't passive designs. With passive decreasing building energy requirements to about 10 to 20% of conventional buildings, fewer solar panels and batteries will be needed. If the available tech isn't economically viable, create it. I will help and LA has enough use cases to make it overall cost saving. Managing water within a building will also help decrease overall energy consumption.",
     "Our power lines do not reflect a first world standard.",
     "It will take time and money but start now where you can and eventually every community will be that much safer.",
     "Obviously. This has to be done, non negotiable.",
     "No brainer, all underground. Mandate for communication companies to underground as well.",
     "\"Paid for by the government\" eventually means paid for by all of us.",
     "Must have, no questions.",
     "the power companies should have done this decades ago.",
     "Fully supportive of this with the caveat that Edison isn't allowed to raise our rates in order to accomplish the project.",
     "This is going to cost billions of dollars and will take decades",
     "We've paid for them to do this over and over again. Make it mandatory, don't subsidize this anymore.",
     "All lines must be buried including phone and cable",
     "Yes for safety and aesthetics.",
     "We also lost our home in the Woolsey fire, and all utilities were underground, but that didn't save us. So I don't rely on buried cables as a complete solution.",
     "This would be amazing!",
     "Underground installation is expensive, and even more expensive if repairs are needed",
     "This is obvious. With the new fire maps, my main north/south escape route is now going through a very high severity fire zone which is completely lined with old power lines on both sides of the street. Having seen the massive amount of downed lines during the fire and now knowing that they were indeed live and in many cases blocked the roads, I feel constantly worried about being blocked in by downed lines or poles when trying to evacuate and concerned that we will have to flee on foot. The power pole outside my house leans at a 75deg angle. Also really tall palm trees are a surprisingly bad wind/fire hazard.",
     "A very high priority against future fires and needs to be systemically linked with moving to renewable energy.",
     "YES YES YES. It is still not happening in my neighborhood in Altadena. SCE is going to do it in the higher elevations. It needs to be done everywhere.",
     "I think it depends on the ares. For example, my area is mostly weak adobe and is prone to movement. Undergroynding utilities works better on more stable land."
