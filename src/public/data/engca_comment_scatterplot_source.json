It was an appalling as well as frightening situation to see well-meaning people trying to direct people trying to flee! Half of them were directing people towards the village from the western area, and others said to head westward!!  It is a miracle that so few lives were lost during that debacle.  And grateful we should all be that this happened in the morning, rather than at night! In fairness, the emergency alarm system did alert people --- but at least 10 minutes after the fire was clearly out of control. Why was the community not alerted a day early",

However the industry wide marketing of disaster (Homeowner)'insurance has led to virtually no polices promising to rebuild \"no matter what\" and substituting coverages that seem to fully protect and do not, leaving most homeowners underinsured which means they can't afford to rebuild and can't stay in their home because it has burned to the ground. This needs to be worked out with the insurance providers and the Dept of Insurance and the homeowners needing and wanting the protection of a policy that will help them in a catastrophe, rather than add to it.",
