The pedestrian infrastructure was likely not impacted by the fires, but the rest obviously have been.  In addition to burying electrical, there should be separate standpipes between homes, in addition to standard hydrants, for fire department (or even homeowner) access, to support mitigation of any future events.  Better reservoir water management and better water infrastructure would help, but in the event of this particular incident, as we would say in the fire service 'is like trying to stop a train with a water hose'.  Just not possible. Which is why, better rebuilding with fire resistant materials is required.",

There was no electronic evacuation warning, cell service, or reverse 911 call in this area, as there were in La Crescenta when the Station Fire was advancing overnight into the neighborhoods. This is unacceptable. The mistakes made that night must never happen again.  Otherwise, the risk is simply too high for people to return.",

This means that people with fewer financial resources (including seniors) are forced to wait until the very last minute to leave--putting themselves in great danger and making the situation more difficult and dangerous for first responders, as well. And because lodging coverage stops as soon as evac orders are lifted, people here were forced to return to unsafe situations, with no running water, no power and no internet (at a time when kids were still doing remote learning due to COVID). The state needs to be aware of this issue and work with insurance providers to resolve it.",
