There is nothing more frustrating than being a law-abiding taxpayer, and watching people take advantage of the system and steal more in tax revenue in one year then I will likely earn in my lifetime.  People just start new corporations or other entities and ultimately have no personal responsibility after not paying any taxes for several years.  The system is way too easy to take advantage of and it very demoralizing to watch it be abused decade after decade and all they would have to do is make it easier to go after known cheaters and remove some of the protections corporations or other entities have and hold the owners responsible for cheating.",

      "content": "I’ve worked on several initiatives aimed at reducing waste and improving efficiency in state operations. One example involved streamlining the internal administrative operations. The original workflow had multiple redundant review layers, causing delays of up to 30 days. Using process mapping and stakeholder interviews, we identified non-value-added steps and consolidated approvals, cutting the turnaround time by 40%.  In another case, I led a Kaizen event to improve customer response times in public requests for service. By analyzing call center data and applying root cause analysis, we restructured the triage process and introduced a simple decision tree for frontline staff. This reduced call escalations by 25% and improved first-contact resolution.  These projects not only improved service delivery but also empowered staff by giving them tools to identify and solve problems on their own.",

      "content": "One of the most enlightening books I've read recently was 'Poverty, by America' by Matthew Desmond. In it, he points out how, while well-intentioned, so many government programs are not being used by those who need the benefits most because they are too difficult to navigate or confusing for people to use. This creates an impression among low-income folks that state government is AGAINST them, not for them. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of distrust between the very people who would most benefit from our services.   We need (not in order): 1. Data: Identify unused gov't services 2. Tech: Provide a unified, easy to remember, accessible access point to connect people with services 3. Reform: Review all public benefits we provide in California from a modern, poverty reduction point of view, at every level, and flag those services that may need legislative reform so we can make recommendations to legislature.  4. Project management: Task force to address poverty (different than homelessness, and not meant to replace current efforts there) in California. 5. Marketing: Make combating poverty our primary focus, drill it into every state department at every level looking for ways to address, including inter-agency efforts and private sector-style promo to draw people in. Almost like a rebrand.  This would be a huge lift but when we have so many services, so many people struggling, plus such a negative impression of gov't, it seems like it would be a win-win-win for everyone.",

In order to entice billionaires to stay in the state (and continue to fund our state government with their income taxes!) we need to do a MUCH better of making housing accessible to every Californian.  Recently, I used Sacramento County 311 to report a homeless individual who was encamped near my house and abusing alcohol to the point he might have died in the summer heat. I am happy to report that someone from the County cleaned up the encampment and removed the trash. However, I have no idea who was responsible for removing the encampment, or what became of the homeless person. To improve our state, I would like it to become common practice for citizens to report encampments and homeless residents AND be able to know what organization responded to the 311 report, and the where the homeless person was taken, and what services they were offered.",

If they were to submit to me a breakdown of any project that I am doing at home,  I paid close attention to the cost and figured out cost of materials and Labor.  I can go online or go to the hardware stores and see the items prices.  I have experienced many times in the State do not pay attention to the cost given by contractors and as long as we, State, have the money we approve the Contractor to start work.  I was asked in a survey about improvements that we can recommend and I mentioned about that way we put a price on a project (estimate).  The following year it was a requirement for us to show how we came up with the Estimated Cost to do the project- Breaking down all the work and cost.  Someone created a database of cost and we started using that database without much thought and my opinion it became worse in coming out with estimating the cost of a project.  The project cost is inflated 60 percent more to make sure we have enough money for the project-  meaning still do not know what we are doing.  If someone comes to my house and give me an estimated cost to place a lighting pole, trench 100 feet, dig a foundation, add a breaker.  Do you think that I can get a quick estimate by going to lows, Home Depot? Yes!  State estimate Cost $65,000 My estimated Cost $17,000",

The desired outcome: less traffic and congestion, fewer auto accidents, and reduced emissions.  I know for example it would save quite a bit money and Staff hours in DHCS, a seemingly unrelated Department, if we can reduce the number of auto accidents occurring in CA.  It's also known that the majority of DHCS funding goes to paying for medical services, so any opportunity to reduce serious injury will also provide state savings.  Beyond that, better public transit can reduce costs of living for Californians, promote better public health outcomes, aid CalEPA's mission, and hopefully in the long term also make Caltrans' job easier, with hopefully less travel infrastructure needing maintenance.",

Now that I been working 4 years in the department, I noticed that across the board hiring and retaining workers is a challenge. For the interview process if people don't show up, they are unable to go lower in the tier to hire candidates that didn't score high but are willing to work. Also people go out on injury for months at a time leaving areas understaffed. They are unable to put a temporary person or hire a new person while that person is on leave. This leaves the rest of the team overworked and unhappy to be doing several people's job. Also moving up we have meetings 1 a year about moving up but they make no effort to communicate with the people interested in moving up. I had communicated several times, and it seems they are always on vacation. I think upwards mobility is a myth. Also when issue's arrive with payroll leading to Sacramento someone is always on vacation. The next person in line usually does not want to be bothered and will not cover their shift unless absolutely necessary. I feel like there needs to be oversight and accountability. Alot of  California's need jobs but without proper instruction to score higher on test, or show how to apply. Or move the people up from lower positions they been working for years we cannot have a flow of employment.",

Low morale is caused by at least two things: 1) not listening or respecting state workers; 2) bad management/unfair division of labor.  When policies are implemented that do not effectively consider the potential impacts on the lives of civil servants, such as RTO--state workers will lose all drive to do good work.  Why work hard for a system that does not care about you and won't listen to you?  Poor leadership has the same effect.  Managers can get stuck in their ways and refuse to rethink processes or challenge other policies/processes that are clearly inefficient--even when their employees are expressing the need for change.  When employees are able to live and work comfortably (by being paid a fair wage, have a good work-life balance, be able to work in safe environments, like their homes, free from distracting co-workers and racist/sexist/inappropriate conduct), and when they see their management step up and be good leaders (by listening, pivoting when needed), that is what will improve efficiency!",

Also if contracts are not adhered to, we still pay the amount the bidders originally stated. (IE, Construction issues, delays, costing more than originally bid for) I think that the end product after a project is completed is also not up to par more often than not and then the State (and its entities) Has to pay more money to have it fixed either by the original contractor or by a new contractor.  What about charging for delays? If a contract for construction takes longer than originally planned (by the bidder) then they are charged per day/week/month extra.  If a contract cost more than originally planned for (by the bidder) than the bidder eats the cost, not the state and the tax payers?  I know some of these options are not viable but there are ways to help save the taxpayer and the state overhead on projects and contracts.",

      "content": "I worked at California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The department depends on accurate, timely data to manage California’s water, yet many workflows remain manual, siloed, and slow. For example, the current processes for generating critical data—like ETaw used in water budget calculations—span multiple teams, take up to 12 weeks, and involve redundant steps such as manual file transfers, duplicated analysis, and outdated tools. These inefficiencies limit transparency, slow responses to urgent requests, and create inconsistencies across programs.  I proposse Land and Water Use Cloud Pilot aims to address these bottlenecks by demonstrating how a modern, cloud-based data stack can streamline workflows. By automating repetitive tasks, integrating land use and water use analyses, and leveraging scalable platforms such as Google Earth Engine and Snowflake, the pilot will reduce turnaround times, improve collaboration, and ensure results are both accurate and transparent.  This proof-of-concept will show how moving from fragmented, manual systems to an integrated cloud environment can cut processing times dramatically (e.g., reducing ETaw delivery from 12 weeks to 4), while laying the foundation for broader adoption of modern solutions across DWR. Ultimately, this approach strengthens our ability to conserve water, respond quickly to partners, and deliver high-value information to millions of Californians",

Technical guidance flows freely, communities of practice thrive, and the work of governance becomes a sacred trust—not a partisan tool.

Even without considering working conditions or what's best for the state employee (although I think telework supports those, too), utilizing telework dramatically reduces overhead costs with no negative impact to work product. Many departments reported improved efficiency during the pandemic with 100% (or near 100%) telework. Telework also improves recruiting, as departments aren't limited to candidates local to Sacramento and can effectively and efficiently hire from across the state. With finances growing tighter and tighter every year, telework is an easy way to address budget shortfalls in a way that unions and employees will also support (as opposed to layoffs and furloughs). I could talk about management inefficiencies, obtuse procedures, and other issues all day long, but this inefficient use of taxpayer dollars is the problem which has the most obvious and straightforward solution that will have the most significant immediate impact.",

Additional Idea – Psychological Safety One area that could make a major difference is strengthening psychological safety in the workplace. From my own challenges, I have seen how difficult it is when employees don’t feel safe speaking up about concerns. On the other hand, when supervisors and leaders model openness and there is a strong support system in place, employees feel empowered to raise issues early, collaborate more effectively, and focus on delivering excellent service. Investing in training and systems that reinforce psychological safety would not only protect employee well-being but also improve performance and service to Californians.",

      "content": "California has many managers within the state government. However, there are few leaders amongst the managers from my viewpoint. And the staff of these managers have no voice. This causes both the management and teams members to stagnate and lose sight of serving the public; eventually many work environments become stressful and toxic.    My idea is to one: give the voice to the team members as this forum does, but allow them to rate their managers or supervisors yearly. Two: measure the amount of turnover on a yearly basis under the tenure of a manager or supervisor. Managers, could be put on yearly training assignments where they can serve in different state organizations. Based on the metrics after 2 or 3 years use the metrics to determine if a manager is effective. If a manager doesn't prove to be effective after this tenure they should be released, re-assigned or demoted. If they are measured to be effective, can they can then be assigned to a permanent position but can be re-evaluated after another 3 years.  This is the basis of my idea. Currently, when a person occupies a managerial seat, there is very little to prevent them from becoming a bottle-neck to progress and there's nothing the team can do about this. I've seen millions of tax payers dollars go to waste because of this scenario. I have seen many managers who are micro-manage out of fear and ignorance and the staff is at their mercy which is a moral killer.  There is no perfect system but we need new direction",

Too much emphasis is placed on rigid rules about where employees sit, how many minutes their breaks are, and other political battles, instead of focusing on improving programs and actually saving money. For example, cutting back on telework only forces more cars onto the road, increases congestion, adds to air pollution, and wastes time and money on commuting and parking. It lowers employee satisfaction and productivity. A better solution is to invest in flexible, results-oriented work structures. Telework should be preserved and expanded where possible, with clear performance metrics and accountability built around outcomes rather than physical presence. This reduces costs tied to office space and commuting while allowing employees to devote more energy to meaningful work that directly benefits Californians.",

I also understand that different departments have different duties and have to keep track of their own programs, but whenever I've worked with other departments on projects it always feels like we're working independently and in competition with each other, not as if we are one: the state of California with one goal. What I do to combat this is I share as much as I can without getting in trouble, but also within my department, if my team creates forms or processes that can be useful to other units, I share it with other fellow units so that they can use it too.",

Many working families face food insecurity or risk of homelessness because their income technically disqualifies them from aid, yet their wages are not enough to meet California’s high cost of living. To solve this, I would propose expanding tiered or “bridge” programs that provide partial assistance on a sliding scale rather than an all-or-nothing cutoff. For example, a working family over the income limit for SNAP could still receive reduced benefits to help offset grocery costs, while rental support could offer temporary subsidies based on local housing markets. Additionally, strengthening public-private partnerships with nonprofits, food banks, and community organizations would stretch resources further. By reimagining assistance as a continuum of support, rather than a strict threshold, we can help stabilize California’s working community and reduce the cycle of crisis many families face despite being employed.",

      "content": "A primary problem I would address is understaffing. At the district where I work, we have been chronically understaffed for as long as I've worked here and long before I started. Presently, we are short two supervisory managers that are needed to help direct key program areas and many full time positions in our district remain unfilled. At the same time, we are told that we need to provide the same, if not higher level of service to the public. This leads to existing staff being worn beyond thin working multiple jobs and duty statements that do not accurately reflect their workload. The situation just feels like a crash happening in slow motion with me as a rank-and-file watching it happen with little that I can do about it.  If I had a magic wand that could easily change things, I would focus on ramping up hiring and retention. I understand there are budgetary considerations, but it is not possible to recruit and retain long term employees if our district does not have any growth opportunities for seasonal staffing. An overreliance on seasonal employees seems to be the crutch that my department relies on, forcing interested seasonals to endure years of attrition and competition before landing a permanent position.  By retaining more long term employees, they will have a better chance of learning how state systems work and managing them efficiently and effectively. Longer term, this will be more sustainable than relying/spending on technology centered \"efficiency\" campaigns.",

It feels like we over emphasize the potential for doing something to have an adverse impact but we deemphasize the potential for not doing something to have an adverse impact. I'd rather we set a clear rulebook for how to build things, pursue and provide the data necessary as a State to make that rulebook clear and easy to understand, and then frequently assess how the rules have been effective or not at achieving the outcomes set by decisionmakers/policymakers.  Subjectivity also leaves room for unjust application of the law but it admittedly does help tackle complex issues that sometimes just need a good judgement call.",

By doing this, such as using updated technology to streamline processes, provide quicker turnaround times, reduce duplicate manual menial tasks, and provide better onboarding and training, California becomes more robust, efficient, and nimble. This also gives the State of California more focus on supporting recipients quickly - and can even place more staff in those areas of need - instead of managing a cumbersome bureaucracy, outdated systems, inefficient technology, poor communication, and delays in getting up to speed with new hires.",

This means explaining that certain things may be done slowly because of understaffing and underfunding, where fully staffed/funded agencies are successful, and when things are done slowly in order to be deliberate and thoughtful in order to be successful long term rather than provide a quick fix. Inversely, when a quick fix is just that, and that there are long term solutions being worked on. To update the mental image of a state worker. The public image is that of a lazy person procrastinating filling out their paperwork, when in reality there may one be a single person who is responsible for processing that paperwork...for the entire state. When I explain this to friends, they're shocked and often way more understanding of public servants after that. I'd like to see more windows into the humanity of these agencies.  I'd like to also see more promotion of these public sector jobs, their importance and what they provide to local communities, etc. We need to move away from thinking about budgets like pie chats and graphs and more like people in buildings, who work all day to improve the public welfare, pushing those numbers (and dollars) towards the most good possible with the current information/resources (hindsight is always 20/20 and we're always looking to improve), and who are regular people, neighbors, and support local communities.",

Many manual processes still cause delays for residents who often wait days or weeks for information that could be delivered instantly with the right technology.  One approach could be requiring agencies to identify and automate high-volume manual processes. Additionally, California could incentivize in-state technology companies through tax breaks or partnerships to help streamline government operations. This would not only improve customer service but also strengthen collaboration with California’s tech sector.  Ultimately, real measurable improvements for residents come down to funding and resources. With proper investment and clear accountability, the State can modernize services and better meet the expectations of Californians.",

Simple things like completing timecards, requesting leave and determining how many hours of leave you have accrued require the employee to access three different databases, and even these databases do not reflect real-time, useful information. I have worked as a County employee in CA, and even the County had real time leave data that could be accessed easily by the employee. In my current employment, I have to track my time, by five minute increments, in one database, I have to add this information to my Outlook calendar, and I have to note it on my timecard. I am hoping there is way all of these databases can be integrated so that we are not spending so much time across multiple platforms to track our time working for the State. I also feel that during the mapping process with the Organizational Improvement Office, OIO, best practices should be shared with all department employees as they are working through their mapping and not at the very end once they have mapped all of the processes for the entire division. This would allow for immediate changes and streamlining to occur, instead of waiting for two years or more for the mapping to be completed before the results are released to the department. Change and innovate as we go, share the knowledge and best practices as soon as it is identified so employees can save valuable time and State money.",

Take a look at our annual plans - they are mostly activity based (we will do x inspections, turn them in in y time, etc.), and other political activity such as that.   Engineering is not that.",

It's one thing to have information posted to a web site, but it's a data dump unless it's descriptive and explanatory to everyone accessing it. For one example, if there is a process that may take 60 to 90 days, such as obtaining a license or certification, have it clearly explained why there is a range of expected time. If people understand the process better, they become less frustrated with it. They may not like it, or agree with the decision, but at least they know that it was a deliberate decision made by actual people and not arbitrary or rubber-stamped.",

Everything is a part of the state, its one central embodiment, but everything is so segregated in a way that hinders our ability to serve the publics interest on a meaningful level and reasonable timeline. The biggest idea I would have is to allow ECOS and PIMS access across entities in a \"view only\" capacity for HR departments. Why can I not do employment A01 verifications myself here for someone in another department? Why can I not see applications provided from a candidate in ECOS to another department? Perhaps they had attached transcripts there that could save 10 days to get here.                Another issue I'd like to address is the use of different documents across state entities. Many processes, policies and procedures begin with guidance from CalHR and the State Personnel Board (SPB) but each department then adapts that guidance using its own forms or supporting docs. This results in inconsistencies across departments. Establishing a standardized process that starts with CalHR and SPB guidance and carries forward uniformly would promote consistency, fairness, and equity across CA.",

There are MANY positions out there that have been \"upgraded\" for what I like to call \"social promotions\". People are promoted instead of Positions based on the work being done and technical skills required to support the mission of the department. Once a position is upgraded, it is very difficult to get it downgraded again when the person moves on, because there is a general perception that more money = better staff. This is not the case. I have seen staff in very handsomely paid positions doing the work of an AGPA. It is also devastating from a succession planning standpoint, because everything becomes so high level that there are no entry level positions to feed the higher-level vacancies. As a result, all new hires are new to the department, and no institutional knowledge is maintained as the more senior folks leave for even further promotions.  Not to mention that the more positions are upgraded inappropriately, the more expensive it is to support. This cuts into programmatic funding meant for carrying out the mission of the department. Unfortunately, this is not a for profit enterprise. We don't have the authority to give financial incentives for loyalty and hard work.",

Also, it is greatly discouraging and prompts employees to put in minimum effort rather than their best effort. Communication is key in many aspects of life, especially work.

      "content": "To improve efficiency and accountability, state government should pair top-down evaluations with structured bottom-up feedback. Currently, employees are reviewed by supervisors, but managers rarely receive input from the staff and programs they oversee. This creates a blind spot: how can managers become better leaders, improve efficiency, and address challenges if they never hear from the people most affected by their decisions?  Once someone becomes a manager, the department’s instinct is often to protect them from criticism. While meant to support leadership, this practice can unintentionally foster waste, fraud, abuse, and inefficiencies. Without meaningful feedback, even well-intentioned managers may not know what needs to change.  A balanced system would introduce safe, constructive ways for staff to share input—such as anonymous surveys or 360-degree reviews—while preserving fairness and professionalism. The goal is not blame, but growth: identifying strengths, addressing weaknesses, and building stronger teams. This feedback loop would improve trust, strengthen programs, and ensure managers are as accountable as the staff they supervise.",

From a Lean Six Sigma perspective, this is pure waste. I’d advocate for consolidating oversight functions and holding the legislature accountable for funding only those upgrades that show measurable process improvements.

Section 8 list is years long - Many are elderly. Some are formerly “normal” people who lost everything in 2008 before they were going to retire & never recovered - Some have criminal records which hinders hiring - Job market is bad right now  FAQ: Why can't they just go to shelters?  - Shelters break families up bc many are separated by gender, so some families prefer to stay together in their cars or on the street - Curfews. Need to be in by 8 pm and out by 6 am, which is hard for working people - Easy place to get your stuff stolen - Not always accommodating for disabled people  FAQ: Why are they on drugs/alcohol? - Some are actually not, they have MH disorders that can look like usage - Some use uppers to stay awake because of theft, assault, etc - Some just like to use, but we shouldn't not help bc of this.

A one size fits all telework model (RTO 2 or 4 days per week regardless of operational need) is not appropriate for most technical positions that can be done effectively from home, is wasteful of taxpayer dollars, and decreases employee morale, all of which impacts public service. Having a one size fits all telework model is also bad for retaining talent. We need technically proficient staff. If talented staff can telework full time with better work life balance and greater physical and mental health, and be treated with respect in managing their workload in the private sector, why would they opt to work for the state where we are treated like we can't be trusted to manage ourselves or allowed to telework based on operational need?  Who wants to work for an entity that frames the need to be in office as \"because teachers and janitors have to report to a job site everyday so should all other state workers\". This approach disrespects the life choices that folks have made regarding their career path. A teacher and a janitor are aware that their work involves reporting to an offsite office daily, whereas technical careers or those that do not require direct face to face with the public should be allowed to telework based on the operational needs of their position. Flexible telework fosters trust, is just as effective for collaboration, and more cost effective.",

      "content": "One of the guidelines stated that we should not discuss telework or return to office policies; however, I noticed that others have posted about it already so I would like to add my request as well. As a state worker for more than 25 years I have enjoyed working in person alongside my peers and building relationships with people that have shared the workload struggles, so I am not arguing against the benefits of having in person collaboration. However, through the years my family situation. Currently, my greatest need would be to have an option for those of us that are caring of very ill and elderly family members or that have other family situations that make it difficult to commute into the office to be able to be exempted from the in-office requirement. We have programs like Paid Family Leave that allow for paid time off to take care of family members, but the needs of aging or ill family members do not always impede our ability to meet our workload commitments and do not meet the requirements for PFL or an RA request. Personally, leaving my mom in the care of a stranger so that I can travel 50 miles to go sit in front of a computer is a big mental, emotional, and financial burden that doesn't make sense when the workload doesn't demand it. Please consider it. I know there are many state workers that would greatly benefit from having an option.",

We need an overarching solution. People don't become homeless overnight, and they won't get out of it overnight. We need to have a 2-pronged approach. 1st - before someone becomes homeless, we need to have a program that would allow them to access grant funding to catch them up and keep them from becoming homeless. It's far less expensive to catch someone up than to pay for all of the services they will need once they are homeless. 2nd - once someone becomes homeless, we need the ability to get them into mid - term (1-2 year) housing with wrap around services to ensure they can have their physical/mental health needs addressed, get or increase their employment, find childcare if necessary, and save money. During this time, they should also have access to financial literacy education, job training, and if needed, drug treatment programs. Waiting until someone has exhausted all options and is sleeping on the street before \"helping them\" by providing them 30 days in a motel, is only perpetuating the problem and keeping people in poverty.",

      "content": "Please consider the process of awarding a construction contract on state-funded projects. The current process of requesting a lump sum bid and then awarding to the lowest bidder has several problems and ultimately costs the state more money and time in the long run. The contracts team needs to create a database and flag contractors who have defaulted, been previously terminated from a project, or have a track record of poor performance. We have been awarding projects to the lowest bidder without being given an opportunity to determine whether that contractor deserves the right to work on a project. If we can establish a resource to the project managers and contracts team to vet through contractors, we should be able to disqualify a bidder due to poor performance, despite being the lowest bidder. The current process in place is actually costing the state more money and time to handle a poor-performing contractor. In addition, bids are requested as a lump sum. This is problematic for several reasons. Once we award a contract to the lowest bidder, we have no way of knowing if that bid actually includes all the requirements of the contract documents. As the process is currently set up, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure their bids cover the scope, however in several cases, the contractor ends up misinterpreting the scope and/or missing essential work. Better communication is key and can set up a project for success in the long run.",

      "content": "There are too many review steps in almost every government process. This usually happens because of errors in the process which lead to management wanting additional review to ensure there are less errors. When errors continue to happen, the review level continues to escalate. This results in leadership thinking their staff are unable to complete the task correctly and frustrating staff on the \"moving target\" or unclear expectations caused by various style preferences from different reviewers. This leads to requirements for staff to create additional documentation such as summaries, cover memos, and routing packets to navigate the higher management level reviewing the work. It is extra, non-value added work to explain what the work is why they are approving it. I recommend lowering the approval level to the lowest supervisory level who knows the program. This will reduce turn-around time for requests, improve customer satisfaction (since they get whatever service we provide sooner), increased confidence in employees, and better morale for teams. Additional levels of review do not eliminate errors, but instead increase them due to different standards between different levels of reviews. Instead, find out why the errors are happening and fix them at the source. This can be done easily between supervisors and front-line staff.",

      "content": "I disagree.  What frightens me most about Telecommuting is that people are only thinking about how it benefits them now.  It is the one thing that is harming our environment and community the fastest, and nobody seems to be paying attention. Think about it.  People that telecommute can live anywhere else in the world and buy up property that at one time was very cheap.  The remote places and small, quiet, serene towns that some of us love to drive through and visit, will soon not exist at all.  During Covid, I lost half my friends and family who have moved across the country to buy up property that was once inexpensive due to Telecommuting.  Now I don’t see them. Property is now being bought up in droves, which has brought up prices of homes at an astronomical rate.  At this rate, perhaps in as little as 20 years, all those remote places will be gone and the big cities will be unlived, hazardous and unkept.  You think it helps the environment because people don't drive, you are wrong.  People have time to shop online get things delivered to their homes, they no longer support their community like they once did, and that means no more stores or restaurants, and all of those boxes and packing material, where do you think it goes?  And I know for a fact that Telecommuting means you are not as productive.  When I visit a friend who telecommutes, he watches TV with me and takes care of his kids and dogs, goes shopping, etc. and I wonder what work he really gets done. Its harmful.",

It is often left to one area of the organization, delegated to staff as other duties as required (without proper training), and can even be sent to outside vendors.

Like others have mentioned, inadequate training resources, limited access to information, and redundant forms often slow down our ability to work efficiently. To address these issues, I’ve taken initiative by using Microsoft Office tools (SharePoint, Power Automate, Power Apps, etc.) that are already available to us at no additional cost to the state.  Here are some of the steps I’ve implemented:  1. SharePoint Site Development -Centralized and standardized all forms required for my role. -Used Power Automate to auto-fill redundant fields, reducing repetitive data entry. -Migrated resources from local drives to the cloud in compliance with IT policies, improving accessibility and collaboration.  2. Interactive Training Resources -Built a Wiki page to consolidate and standardize the training I’ve received from management. -Created step-by-step work instructions with embedded GIFs (instead of static screenshots) so employees can visually follow the process in real time.  By streamlining processes and digitizing resources, I’ve helped improve efficiency, reduce errors, and make information easier to access—all while keeping costs neutral for the state.",

      "content": "One of the challenges that needs further analysis is the replacement of staff when they move on from State Service. In most cases, departments are unable to fill vacancies until after the position becomes vacant. This leads to an exodus of knowledge and expertise from the department that is not easily replaced as it often takes years for an individual to become fully proficient in their role, establish connections with others and gain career long learning. While this practice may lead to salary savings, it creates a knowledge deficit which then leads to efficiency loss until such time as the individual staff person learns the position and becomes proficieint and beyond. If departments had the ability to hire replacement staff while the existing staff person was still present, the knowledge transfer would be more streamlined, and the institutional knowledge can be much more easily passed on to the new staff member. An in-between step might involve the creation of desk manuals for new staff to access however these will not necessarily impart the same level knowledge as the in person tutelage of the out-going staff member.",

      "content": "The contracting process is broken. Californians want government to have easy to use online tools, one-stop-shop permits, data access portals, and to use the latest technology to make people's lives better. Both IT and non-IT contracts are cumbersome and require navigating gate keepers who do not understand agency needs. If a project is deemed IT by contracting personnel, my agency will simply not move forward. If a contract gets flagged for the PAL process with CDT, the contract is dead, and we will never resubmit. Money lasts 3 years, and the PAL process can take that long, leaving no time for the money to be used on the intended project. Further, getting non-IT contracts through DGS is time-consuming and cumbersome with little added value, decreasing the time for the money to actually do work.   My suggestion would be to loosen up contract oversight on the frontend, actually provide training to staff, and provide more resources for auditing and enforcement of contract rules and ethics on the backend. In this way, SME staff will be trained on contract creation and execution (which is currently not the case) and can quickly get money out in flexible ways, taking advantage of as much of the 3 year money lifetime as possible, while knowing that they must strictly adhere to contract rules or their money will get pulled back and contracts will get cancelled. If you want staff to move fast, and use technology, this has to change.",

To make California's government more effective in responding to this crisis, I suggest that State properties be reevaluated to see if entire properties or portions of properties would be suitable for housing conversion. For example, the agency I work for has a large open parking lot adjacent to its office building, all of which is State property and near public transit. Could we maximize the use of this open parking lot by moving the parking space underground and building medium to high density housing units on top? Could there be a public-private partnership so that the State continues to own the land but leases it to a private developer so that the State ensures its needs are met? I know some transit agencies are converting transit parking lots into housing developments. Akin to some school districts, could we dedicate a portion of new housing to State employees at a discounted rate to attract and retain State employees?",

For example, many departments are still relying on PDF forms for timekeeping management, which slows down the processes, increases errors, and limits accessibility.  To solve this I would prioritize modernization of internal systems by moving toward cloud -based, user friendly platforms that allow for real-time updates, digital signatures, and mobile access and also provide adequate training especially for LEADERSHIP! Another major issue is how state departments communicate to the public.  Too often, forms, notices, websites, and presentations are written in dense bureaucratic language that can be confusing.  I would recommend shifting toward PLAIN LANGUAGE communication across all state agencies, making information clear, simple and accessible to all Californians.  Alongside this, we should invest in practical resources like website tutorials, FAQs, or short instructional YouTube videos, that guide people step by step filling out forms and accessing services or joining public online meetings.",

As someone mentioned in this chain - it is as easy as analyzing and identifying areas were we can cut down on bureaucratic surplus - and yet we have failed to resolve this problem.   Among the soft skills, \"effective communication\" is were we lack the most - I have witnessed both seasoned and inexperienced employees lacking this skill. Although fewer,  we do have some \"effective communicators\" and mentoring/shadowing with these folks can go a long way in learning effective communication and boosting confidence. Last but not the least, the lack of \"passion/pride/ownership of the work\" is very common in government employees across the board. This problem can be addressed by hiring inspirational leadership (or having motivated/passionate individuals at leadership level) that can motivate the employees to be the best versions of themselves. Once passionate, the employees will be highly productive/efficient/confident and our state will become a role model  for government efficiency/effectiveness.",

Currently, we've created a system where districts spend enormous resources crafting grant narratives that sound impressive rather than implementing practices that actually work. A small rural district with a proven intervention might lose funding to a larger district with better grant writers, even when the rural district's approach would deliver better results for students. The Core Problem: We're funding narrative ability instead of educational effectiveness. Districts hire consultants to write compelling grants while the money that should go to students gets trapped in a bureaucratic approval process that prioritizes compliance documentation over evidence-based outcomes.",

Why do so many people need to sign off on routine documents? Why is there so much oversight from external agencies? These layers of approval rarely add value, and upper management often doesn’t even read the documents. For example, it took nearly three years just to get an RFP out the door. That’s unacceptable.",

This process becomes unnecessarily repetitive because these vendors are already approved suppliers that we’ve worked with before. It doesn’t make sense to require the same paperwork for every purchase when the information and compliance status haven’t changed. The redundancy creates excess paperwork, slows down procurement, and adds unnecessary administrative burden for both us and the vendors.  Additionally, requiring a signed RFQ seems redundant when the vendor is already providing an official quote on their company letterhead, which inherently serves as their formal offer.  A more efficient approach would be to have vendors complete these forms once per year, or only when there’s a material change to their status, rather than for every individual quote.",

Auto Inspectors should be advocating for the State's vehicles and equipment being maintained for safe operation and should be HELPING employees with the process. There is currently no process in place for when DGS will not approve a repair since SCO requires the DGS stamp of approval (for auto repairs over the established dollar amounts) in order to process voucher payments. DGS needs to work with state agencies instead of against us in this matter. Proactive communication and training should be available and provided to enforce and educate on changing expectations.",

Solution is to continue to consolidate classifications. There's also lot of management, some new, that are not trained how to manage within state regulations/practices. There's a lack of understanding/balance of being engaging, caring and yet firm, setting expectations and keeping employees accountable. (Or for some, to not be so caring, that they fail to hold employees accountable.) It's not modeled by managers that have been in state service for years. Sometimes, we push things like performance evaluations for compliance, but the quality and engagement are severely lacking. One solution is to update the 80-hour training to be \"real talk\" and not philosophical / general principles. New managers need more performance management and employee engagement training. It shouldn't be self-paced where we know some just click through e-learning without really learning.",

The Department of Insurance (DOI) houses the Fraud Division, a law enforcement unit operating within a regulatory agency. Simultaneously, $80.9 million in annual grant funding is distributed to county District Attorney’s (DA) Offices to prosecute fraud cases. This dual structure presents several challenges: Conflicting Missions: Regulatory agencies prioritize industry oversight and collaboration, which can conflict with the enforcement and prosecutorial roles of law enforcement. Operational Inefficiencies: DOI lacks the infrastructure, procurement agility, and legal support systems typical of dedicated law enforcement agencies. Jurisdictional Gaps: Only counties receiving grants can pursue fraud cases, leaving many areas underserved and creating geographic inequities. Short-Term Incentives: Grant-based funding encourages quick wins over long-term, complex investigations. Ethical Concerns: Financial incentives tied to prosecutions raise questions about the impartiality of justice. Recruitment and Retention Issues: DOI struggles to retain investigators, many of whom leave for better opportunities at the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Proposed Solution The proposal recommends transferring the DOI’s Fraud Division (163 peace officers and 75 support staff) and the $80.9 million in grant funding to the California Attorney General’s Office.",

      "content": "One of the primary problems I would address is the state’s resistance to fully embracing telework, despite clear evidence that it benefits both employees and the public. For decades, Californians have struggled with long commutes, congested freeways, and poor air quality. As a state employee, I see firsthand how commuting drains productivity, raises costs for workers, and contributes to pollution that affects every Californian. Forcing employees back into offices undermines efficiency, increases taxpayer costs for office space and reimbursements, and contradicts the state’s own climate goals.  The solution is simple: expand and normalize telework as the default option whenever the duties of a position can be performed remotely. This requires modernizing policies, investing in secure technology, and measuring performance based on outcomes instead of physical presence. Employees should be trusted to deliver results, and in my experience, productivity and responsiveness actually increase when telework is supported. By keeping more workers at home, California can cut emissions, save money, and provide faster, more effective services to residents. Telework is not just a perk. It is a strategy that addresses climate change, budget efficiency, and the quality of public service all at once.",

Although we have contracts governing how they handle this data contracts alone are not enough to protect citizens from the fallout should these companies' data centers become compromised. The sole responsibility for governing and protecting California citizens data rests with the state and its civil service. My solution to this problem would be for the California Department of Technology restart it's program to create a state cloud. The technology to do so has come a long way since it's last attempt and there is opportunity to recruit recently laid off tech workers into the civil service to support such a project as well as opportunities for more smaller local technology companies to engage in contract work to support the open-source software that will underpin it all. This would ensure that California data is protected and guarded by Californian's as well as California leading the way in Data and Technology governance.",

As a result, departments struggle to share knowledge, coordinate resources, and work toward common goals, reducing overall efficiency and effectiveness.  Solution: Proposed Solution: Foster Collaboration and Shared Resources Shift from siloed, centralized structures toward a more connected, collaborative model. This can be done by creating cross-departmental working groups, shared digital platforms, and standardized processes that encourage transparency and knowledge sharing. By streamlining workflows and pooling resources, departments can reduce redundancy, improve efficiency, and deliver more consistent and effective services to Californians.",

      "content": "Right now, ASL Interpreters in California state service are often managed by people who don’t understand the profession or the needs of the Deaf/Hard of Hearing community. This creates mismanagement, inconsistent access, and unnecessary strain on both interpreters and the people they serve. A practical, immediate step would be to require each state department that employs ASL Interpreters to have an ASL Interpreter Coordinator—a position held by a qualified interpreter. This model already exists in the State Schools, where interpreters are managed effectively by someone with lived professional expertise. Expanding that model across departments would ensure proper support, accountability, and better access for Deaf/Hard of Hearing employees and clients. Longer term, California could take a bold step by creating a Department of Language to house and organize all interpreters statewide—including ASL, Spanish, and other languages. This would centralize resources, guarantee professional management by people who understand the work, and ensure that language access is treated as an essential public service. Importantly, this would also allow interpreters to be shared across departments, so that if a DMV office (for example) suddenly needed an ASL Interpreter, the Department of Language could quickly dispatch one. This approach strengthens equity, efficiency, and accessibility across the state.",

It would also help cut down the number of times an individual has to share their information.  I understand that California has the Open Data Portal, but not all departments participate and that is to report deidentified data.  A solution to solve this problem could be to require all departments to participate in a shared data base, sharing information and working together to have the most up to date information.  Departments could also potentially share the cost of creating such a platform.  This could potentially eliminate some of the separate database changes taking place at other departments and modernize older systems.  This could also help HHS comply with some of the new CMS Final Rules by allowing cross reporting and by making sure each individual is only counted one time.  I would love to hear other solutions.",

My restricting state employment to California and an in-office requirement, we are immediately limiting the ability to recruit the best and the brightest.  Although California is a great place to live, we exclude individuals who would be great assets to the state, both in mind and talent, if they don't want to relocate.  This creates an unnecessary barrier to recruiting the best, which only helps our state succeed.  My suggestion would be to identify classifications and areas which require unique and specalized skillsets and expanding the ability of those classifications to have more flexible remote work option.",

The back up works the pending items as the necessary information is provided or updates are made. When the peer returns the back up provides a summary of what has been completed and what is outstanding.  The back up usually gets extra support for their peers to ensure nothing is missed. This is a win-win for everyone because the person that is out gets to enjoy their time off, work doesn't stop, deadlines aren't missed, when the person returns they are able to return without the stress of playing catch up, and the peers that are working know when they take time off they get the same benefits. This works when you set the expectation from the beginning and you take the time to cross train your team and if you have documented processes.

The system would:  Automatically identify which permits and agencies are triggered.  Generate a single project ID to track progress across agencies.  Push project information to agencies in their required formats.  Host shared communications, map uploads, and condition tracking.  Consolidate agency conditions into one coordinated, conflict-checked permit package.  Enable online fee payment in a single transaction.

It addresses issues like racism, sexism and harassment and directs the attention of the teams to completing the tasks at hand.

It would be most helpful to actually have our CONTROL AGENCIES truly control, provide THEIR interpretation to laws/rules/regs that should be applied across the board, and have them develop the statewide policies (not just as a model) and practices that are most defensible to create standardization and consistency across agencies.",

I'm pushing hard for a different approach – one that's all about building real leadership skills. We need to focus on helping people connect, understand emotions, and level up their professional game. Imagine managers who can actually spot what each team member needs to grow and thrive. This isn't just about training; it's about creating a workplace where people feel supported, challenged, and excited to bring their best selves to work. By investing in our people like this, we're not just checking HR boxes – we're building a team that's flexible, motivated, and ready to crush whatever challenges come our way.

The way our duty statements are written and who we prioritize within the hiring process often promotes individuals into leadership roles with very specific (often niche) knowledge, but frequently lacking leadership skills (like compassionate communication, relational intelligence, teambuilding, conflict resolution, creative intelligence, etc). I would suggest two things: Add new AGPA roles (e.g., AGPA 1, AGPA 2, etc) to allow for growth within analyst positions and reduce the need to transition into leadership for monetary purposes. The same is likely true for other position types. And I would also institute better leadership development programs. What we offer now is below minimum standard and/or often suggestive in nature - you \"could\" take X Course, but why do it when you're so busy. I would like to see distinct and explicit development programs, mentorship opportunities, and a clear progression path that tracks which leaders are not only learning these skills but applying them, and then make job opportunities for them to succeed and evolve within their career. I think with better leadership a lot of the bureaucracy, bottlenecking,  communication, and problem-solving issues we face would likely \"get better\" on their own.",

      "content": "Flatten the organization. Multi-tier mgmt hierarchies tend to result in excess procedural steps thereby slowing the overall process. Eliminate \"red tape\" where none are needed.  Review steps in a process to assess value in the overall procedure. If step(s) don't serve a legitimate purpose then the procedure should be tightened up to improve & fast track the execution of the procedure. In short, streamline by investigating the overall process for value & timeliness. Pare down where there are redundant or no-value steps/processes.  If there is an opportunity to automate a process/procedure, empower knowledgeable staff to explore/implement solutions even if there is an intended enterprise-wide solution targeted for deployment downstream. There is value in short-term solutions which, until a potential future large-scale solution is implemented (which can sometimes/often be unavailable for years), can greatly reduce considerable man-hours that would otherwise be necessary.  Create bridges between units that share knowledge, require similar experience/tools, feed information across units, present opportunities to consolidate & standardize output either for internal or public use. There are current silos of units that have very similar processes but are handled/implemented differently. Normalize processes across these silos.  Establish inter-division training plans to retain staff expertise. Grow/support internal advancement plans based on org job forecast. Hire from within.",

      "content": "California’s government must recommit to a centralized IT strategy—one that prioritizes shared services, specialized expertise, and fiscal responsibility. The current decentralized approach, where individual departments manage their own IT infrastructure, is inefficient, costly, and misaligned with the state’s legislative intent.  Many state agencies were created to fulfill specific missions—public health, transportation, education, and more. Yet today, these departments are investing significant time, energy, and capital into building and maintaining their own IT systems. This diverts focus from their core responsibilities and leads to duplication of effort, fragmented infrastructure, and inconsistent standards.  The California Department of Technology (CDT) was established to solve this problem. Assembly Bill 2408 and the resulting Government Code provisions laid the foundation for a centralized IT model—one that consolidates services, reduces redundancy, and enables departments to focus on their primary missions while leveraging CDT’s expertise.  Despite this mandate, many departments continue to operate isolated IT silos. This not only undermines the intent of AB 2408, but also wastes taxpayer dollars and slows statewide progress. The result: overlapping systems, inconsistent security protocols, and missed opportunities for innovation.",

Since videoconference hearings became available, the vast majority of parties have chosen to utilize them. This allows individuals to take an hour or two off work instead of an entire day and avoid having to find childcare because they can participate from home. People save significant time by eliminating the need to drive or fly to a hearing, in addition to the carbon emissions from those trips. This change saves average Californians and small businesses hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.  It also saves the state money. California agencies that pay for hearings no longer have to reimburse participants for the time and mileage spent traveling to hearings. If there is a default, those costs are completely wasted. Agencies that shift to remote offerings can make a substantial impact by reducing travel costs and minimizing waste, particularly important in our current fiscal climate.",

Because government is structured to focus on a need being met, there is little interest in ensuring that the need being met is done in an efficient and cost effective manner. Agencies are punished for not spending all the money allocated to them because the next year, their budget gets reduced. This creates a use it or lose it mentality, and less concern is given on whether we are being good stewards of the public's money. To solve this problem, policies must be set that reward agencies that save the government money rather than penalizing them by reducing their future budget.   Another problem is that state agencies do not talk to each other.  We are all under the State umbrella, however, no collaboration or connection opportunities exist to be able to compare notes. Most agencies face similar problems and the ability to discuss possible solutions or even understanding what other agencies have done to address their problems is a missed opportunity.  There is no where that allows us to see the organization structure, duty statements, or reports completed by other agencies. There is no directory to reach out to other agencies and collaborate.  I would create a state agency directory and a policy would have require state agencies to comply by sharing their organization charts as well as contact information to other areas.  I would restrict access of executive leadership to only executive leadership.",

We need to reduce redundant frameworks, streamline operations, and encourage departments to consolidate and collaborate across silos. Efficiency shouldn’t be a buzzword—it should be a mandate. But this isn’t just about internal reform. It’s about reimagining the physical footprint of government. Many office buildings now sit underused or entirely vacant. These spaces represent an opportunity—not a liability. By converting surplus government buildings into affordable housing, we can breathe new life into downtown economies that have long depended on a steady flow of government workers.This kind of transformation would not only address housing shortages but also diversify and strengthen urban centers. It’s a chance to shift from a government-centric downtown to a community-centric one—where people live, work, and thrive in more dynamic, inclusive environments.",

By shifting to remote offerings, such as the ability to participate in hearings and government decisions by videoconference, we can ensure that people who live in more distant (and often more affordable) areas are given equal opportunities to have their voices heard and contribute to shared goals.  Remote offerings further align with California’s climate goals, avoiding tons of CO₂ that would otherwise be generated as Californians waste time and money driving to formerly in-person meetings. Videoconference offerings also help us include Californians with disabilities who may struggle to join us in person due to challenges with transit and accessibility.   Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many state agencies have vastly enlarged the group of individuals who can participate through the change to remote and videoconference meetings and hearings. This conversion to a more accessible meeting style should be expanded so more people can benefit.",

We should be using electronic/virtual options wherever possible. Allow ECH/ACH/EFT payments to vendors. Use electronic communications. Strive to reduce wasteful spending on office and storage space by moving to a more modern virtual space. Revamp our websites to make them more user friendly and improve functionality.

First and foremost, make it easy to build affordable housing. Recognize that homelessness is a housing problem.   2nd, Prioritize the people who just slipped into homelessness and have potential and will to come out of it. Help them to come out permanently and join mainstream.  Right now, I serve as board member for HART of Folsom, and we are proud to have reduced Folsom's homelessness by 10% this way. 3rd, go deeper and help people that are homeless longer and probably will never come out.  Build shelters with services for them and make rules to humanely require them to take those services. Those rules might curtail some of their freedom, but they should know that it's cost to pay for not being able to come out of homelessness by themselves.   Finally, to do all this work, encourage and fund the non-profits directly from the state so that the rules are uniform. One positive side effect is that more non-profit jobs are created this way. Each city and county having its own rules and managing and distributing funds will only create more red tape and confusion and dysfunction. Re-organize the current machinery and people work under one state agency with simple and uniform set of rules.",

We heard from the customer. Team members demonstrated a genuine curiosity about what was happening in other sections. Learning was happening as we were studying the process.   Projected fiscal savings for the project was estimated at $13M. Some of my team's fiscal resources have been streamlined and simplified. This greatly reduces our customer's time performing fiscal processes.

      "content": "Problem: In many state departments, including my own, productivity is often hindered by rigid processes where documents must pass through multiple layers of review—sometimes six or more—before finalization. This not only delays critical deliverables but can render documents outdated or irrelevant by the time they are approved. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in collaboration and communication between subject matter experts (SMEs) and executive leadership. This disconnect often leads to a reactive environment where teams are constantly putting out fires instead of proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. Solution: Introduce a tiered review system that empowers mid-level managers and SMEs to approve routine documents without requiring executive-level sign-off. This would reduce bottlenecks, increase accountability, and allow leadership to focus on strategic priorities. Implementing digital workflow tools with built-in version control and approval tracking can also enhance transparency and speed. Establish regular cross-functional strategy sessions between SMEs and executives to align on goals, anticipate challenges, and co-create solutions. This would shift the culture from reactive to proactive, encouraging innovation and long-term planning. Additionally, investing in leadership training that emphasizes trust in employee expertise and decision-making can help break down hierarchical barriers and build a more agile, responsive organization.",

Waterfall is great for smaller projects when one can reasonably estimate the scope, time, and resources needed to complete a project. Agile is better when two of those items are a little fuzzy because the project is large, but it's the only way to get the project to succeed. I have seen projects fail because state control agencies attempt to run projects one way while the department they are overseeing wants to do it the other way. First, CDT needs to have clearly defined approaches for both methodologies. Second, as part of the pre-work (e.g., FSR part), there needs to be an open discussion between CDT and the organization that is undertaking the project about which methodology should be used for the project to level-set expectations. Finally, as part of the FSR process, CDT should insist on receiving an entity-attribute diagram for the data that is passing through the system, so that they know that the IT team understands what it is that they are trying to build. All three of these points will reduce the risk of IT project failure.",

The goal is for the desk manual to be a resource that makes it easier and quicker for new Associates to learn what their responsibilities are, and how to do them. And also provide a resource whenever an Associate needs to do something they don't do often.  Working on the section that I was assigned helped me understand that process better.

Measurable results for state agencies require significant projects, supported by proper funding, a strong project team, and effective project management with government oversight to ensure deliverables are met.  In my department, I have participated in several such projects that enhanced both customer service and internal processes. For example, we improved how customers contact us, streamlined the way they receive information, and even developed tools that anticipate and provide needed information before customers realize they need it. These enhancements not only improved efficiency internally but also provided a better overall experience for Californians interacting with the department.  At a more practical level, I have also seen opportunities to improve efficiency by making better use of tools we already have, such as SharePoint, Excel, and OneNote. Often, staff lack training or examples of how to apply these tools effectively. Within my team, we began using SharePoint as a case management tool and OneNote as a shared notebook to store and share information. These small but tangible steps have helped streamline collaboration, improve knowledge sharing, and reduce inefficiencies in day-to-day work.",

While policy requires double checking AI output, it is incredibly inefficient and embarrassing to have to retroactively correct published AI-generated hallucinations. I have used Copilot for non-work purposes, but these inaccuracies make me extremely hesitant to use it for my work, which involves data analysis and coding.

The two-week new supervisor/manager training is a waste of time and doesn't cover most of what managers actually face. There are so many leadership development and coaching programs in the private sector that could benefit state employees, like Harvard Business Review or Stanford. Lareg companies often have leadership development tracks. VSP, for example, has two types of tracks you can enroll in -- one for those wanting to become executives and a second track for those who want to be subject matter expert leaders (but not necessarily an exec). They provide mentors, hold classes, and you feel encouraged that you're proactively growing professionally.  Employee management training, specifically, is reactive instead of proactive. I've worked closely with performance management units to discuss personnel issues and sent emails or disciplinary plans for their review. Rather than being trained ahead of time, before issues start, I'm stuck with escalating issues waiting for PMU to review emails and provide guidance. And then their guidance changes frequently depending on what they've recently experienced in court. It's immensely frustrating.",

I recently looked into getting solar for my home and would be happy to feed extra energy into the grid to make it cheaper for everyone, but after everything was said and done, with current incentives, I would pay more for solar than I would for my current SMUD bill.

If we all knew each other better personally and/or professionally, people may feel more motivated and part of a team that puts out good work. As someone who is newer to state service, I know this is difficult and often discouraged for a reason; however, allowing an environment where a lack of communication and respect for coworkers to flourish is detrimental.",

      "content": "As a Californian and state employee, one idea I would add is the need for stronger accountability in leadership. Many employees see innovative, research-backed proposals—like expanding remote work, modernizing hiring, or streamlining processes—dismissed not because they lack merit, but because leadership defaults to outdated practices or prioritizes optics over efficiency. This discourages staff from raising ideas and reinforces a culture where “do as you’re told” outweighs evidence-based improvement.  I also believe the state should re-examine how closely it aligns with corporate pressures. For example, enforcing return-to-office mandates to mirror private sector demands undermines both efficiency and equity, especially when research and state audits clearly show that remote work saves millions in costs, improves productivity, and reduces emissions. It is difficult for employees to trust in California’s commitment to innovation when decisions conflict with the very data the state commissions.  From my perspective as a Californian, a government that models fairness, inclusion, and modern workplace practices builds greater public trust. Investing in remote-first policies, skills-based hiring, and leadership accountability would not only improve the employee experience but also deliver better outcomes for the people of California.",

They are very labor-intensive, and it seems like a lot of these reports just pull and compile information DGS already has in their fleet and facility databases.  Some of these reports, like the sustainability roadmap, take SO much time.  It probably costs each department at least a couple staff worth of people just to handle DGS' reporting requirements, and these are resources that could otherwise be providing services to taxpayers and fee payers. DGS should make a list of all the reports they require, do an analysis of what each one is used for and whether or not there's even a benefit, see where some can be consolidated or can be taken over by DGS since they already have the data, and then free those resources up so departments can better serve the public instead.",

I would love to one day see the state consolidate multiple departments into something like the FTB campus, freeing up space by making telework the default work type for any position that does not require work to be done in office. Embracing telework in this way opens up state jobs to many more Californians all across the state rather than just people that live in a couple metro areas, it would reduce carbon emissions and traffic, as well as lower the cost of road maintenance in those areas, as well as be a huge benefit to the all employees. The FTB campus also has lightrail access, as well as a free parking lot, which would be a cost savings to employees who currently work downtown and have to pay for parking. the money saved from things like this could be used to help departments balance their budget and we would be able to better fund things that actually benefit residents of the state.  I know this is an incredibly lofty idea, and would require a lot of planning, but I think it could provide a great deal of savings, and would make jobs with the state more appealing to most people. if we as a state are committed at being the best, we need to embrace forward thinking tactics, not stick to \"what we always have done\"",

From my experience as an employee and union steward, it seems that disabled employees are treated like a burden during the reasonable accommodation process, especially if they are requesting telework. In most cases when the employee's doctor is recommending telework as a reasonable accommodation, departments will do anything to delay or deny telework as a reasonable accommodation. Departments have continually been allowed to ignore and violate the ADA, EEOC, and FEHA policies and regulations and oppose doctor's recommendations for appropriate reasonable accommodations.   As a whole, the state needs to hold departments accountable for following appropriate policies and regulations pertaining to reasonable accommodations. More timely processes and procedures should be implemented. It is unreasonable to allow each department's EEO unit/section 90 days to investigate themselves, while not providing an employee with a disability their recommended reasonable accommodations. A more consistent and streamlined approach needs to be developed to help support California's employees with disabilities to better provide them more equitable and inclusive work environment when working for the state.",

      "content": "Several problems really. But, the first is the integration of newer technology into the workplace. Each State agency has individual IT departments without a centralized, standardized model for operations. Yes, CDT exists, but they have limited control over which systems each agency uses. This minimizes their ability to provide statewide solutions to tech-based problems. It also means that each agency is essentially trying to solve their tech problems independently, sometimes without the necessary expertise to do so. This same idea applies to HR departments. Each HR department is under the guidance of CalHR, but often do things their own way. That lack of standardization causes issues in the short and long term, as policies and procedures are often more at the whim of senior leadership, without a larger strategy, and can even, at times, be in conflict with CalHR expectations. In both the CDT and CalHR cases, having these agencies be the owner of all IT and HR positions that are effectively deployed to other State agencies could resolve the lack of standardization across both critical functions. It ensures that every position receives the same base training for their respective fields, and even centralizes the hiring process for thousands of positions, freeing up other State agency partners to focus on their individual mission areas.",

      "content": "One of the simplest ways to immediately make government run more efficiently, is to institute full-time telework across state agencies. This would increase efficiency by enabling the ability of employees to get more done, decrease greenhouse gas emissions from personal vehicles, and save the state money by getting rid of excess office space.   Many state agencies also make the claim of wanting to increasing employee personal wellness, job/life balance, and spending more time with family. Full-time telework would solve these issues, and many similar ones as well.   It's time to move forward and embrace new ideas, and more efficient ways of doing things. This takes courage and leadership from the top, which has been in short supply these last few years. Full-time telework is an answer to more government efficiency at all levels, and California should act as the bellwether for all other States to follow on this issue.",

      "content": "A major problem in California’s state workforce is the inefficiency caused by outdated hiring and workplace policies. Rigid minimum qualifications and slow/ouutdated HR protocols block many talented candidates with modern skills from entering public service, which limits innovation and slows progress.  An even larger issue is the state’s approach to workplace flexibility. Despite state audits and extensive research showing that remote work increases productivity, saves the state millions in office space costs, reduces emissions, and improves work-life balance, some leaders continue to enforce return-to-office mandates. This is hypocritical for a government that speaks of innovation, equity, and efficiency while ignoring evidence that remote work achieves those goals more effectively than traditional office models.  To address these challenges: First, modernize hiring by replacing outdated minimum requirements with skills-based assessments and streamlined digital applications. Second, adopt remote-first policies that align with research and fiscal responsibility, prioritizing cost savings, efficiency, and fairness for workers. Third, strengthen protections against retaliation and ensure leadership training emphasizes equity, accountability, and inclusion.  By modernizing hiring and committing to evidence-based remote-first practices, California can move past outdated systems and demonstrate it is serious about equity, innovation, and effective public service.",

For example, reframing that the people we serve are customers has been incredibly inspiring. The State does not need to market, per se, to get people to use their products. On the flip side, the State does not have to measure or iterate on an existing product. So that means we fall into the \"we've always done it this way\" problem.  Leaders who want their departments to meet the expectations the public has in their personal lives leads to innovation. If you can order food on your phone, turn on your camera with an app, certainly, you don't need to use Microsoft Edge on a desktop to fill out a form or print a .pdf to get your needs met.  Also it's important to seek ideas from the boots on the ground staff. They are working in lock step with customers and have already identified the needs that won't be met with a traditional RFP approach.",

      "content": "One of the primary problems I see in California government is that our technical infrastructure is outdated and creates unnecessary barriers for both employees and the public. For example, many departments are still relying on PDF forms for timecards and approvals, which slows down processes, increases errors, and limits accessibility. To solve this, I would prioritize modernization of internal systems by moving toward cloud-based, user-friendly platforms that allow for real-time updates, digital signatures, and mobile access. This would save staff time, reduce administrative burden, and increase efficiency across departments. Another major issue is how state departments communicate with the public. Too often, forms, notices, and websites are written in dense, bureaucratic language that can be confusing. I would recommend shifting toward plain language communication across all state agencies, making information clear, simple, and accessible to all Californians. Alongside this, we should invest in practical resources like website tutorials, FAQs, or short instructional videos (e.g., YouTube walk-throughs) that guide people step-by-step in accessing services or filling out forms. Additionally, California has many departments that offer overlapping or complementary services—such as the Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) and the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), which often work with the same populations but in different ways. Stronger cross-department collaboration.",

I have now been in two units where this was a problem. In one there was a mass exit of employees who had been there for a long time (including myself), and in the other, they had extremely high turnover, most employees using return rights and not staying more than six months. Exit interviews should be conducted for every employee, no exceptions, and taken seriously, with actions being put in place to retain future employees. In the first scenario, losing the long-term staff put a massive workload on those of us who stayed, causing a decrease in moral and a loss of historical knowledge, which lead to more staff leaving. The management's poor behavior continued and because no changes were made, the work environment was extremely toxic. In the second scenario, the manager was an extreme micromanager who would single out and belittle staff, frequently teaming up with another manager to gang up on a single staff member. I know these scenarios are not unique, which is why I believe exit interviews for each and every exiting employee are essential, but only if they are taken seriously, good or bad.",

As Silicon Valley pushes their ideas of innovation and visions of the future, I can't help but feel that the basics are being ignored. Sure, there are a lot of things that can be automated with better software and the pursuit of efficiency, but we have fundamental issues that have hardly been addressed and papered over in the pursuit of an overly idealistic future driven by marketing and the unending quest for financial profit.  Particularly in this moment where students of all ages are leaning on AI to complete basic coursework, we are at a critical juncture for ensuring future generations can think for themselves. How can people govern themselves if they cannot arrive at a conclusion through their own thought processes?  Let's focus on improving the fundamentals before jumping onto bandwagons.",

After 36 years of state service and raising 3 kids, there are sacrifices that are always made. After covid we became a society that has been taught that my life comes first. You're not paid for that. sorry.  State service is like all other industries that relate to service. You give to make others' lives better through helping or doing for someone. Lastly, someone mentioned that they work and those who don't should be dealt with. you are completely right whether in or out of the office. Unfortunately, it is much harder to see the non-work time outside. This is why many people are known to have 2 jobs during the workday or just playing. Thanks all.",

AJCCs provide many wonderful services to the public including connecting jobseekers and employers; case management on job-related services such as resume writing, job applications, interview preparation; on-the-job training and apprenticeships; secondary and post-secondary education attainment; veteran services; assistance to migrant seasonal farmworkers; and, much more. Unfortunately, whenever people ask me what I do for a living and I tell them about the services we provide, they are oftentimes shocked that all of these services even exist. When I tell them I work for the EDD, they automatically think I work for the Unemployment Insurance Branch or Disability Insurance Branch. The primary problem is that I don't think the state does enough to spread the word of our programs and the AJCCs and their purpose. The idea I have to solve this problem would be more advertisement whether that be pamphlets throughout state buildings or TV advertisements. I haven't really thought about the logistics or cost of all this. I just think that there needs to be more information given to the public.",

I also think CalHR should have oversight on this matter to ensure employees are able to take advantage of the training that is available while also providing career guidance tools. Setting a minimum threshold for training hours per employee, per year, could help with this goal, along with creating a Career Support website full of tools and guidance. More education will result in better retention, a more educated workforce, and a reduction in sick hours because employees will feel supported and enriched. This will all lead to more production within the tasks that are required to run the state, which will save the state money over time. You see this in the private sector, from which many of us came from.",

Enabling staff at all levels to work from home allows staff to avoid expensive commutes and devote more energy to their work and families. As a manager, my observations have been that in-office work has done nothing to boost productivity among my staff and only hurts morale. If the state wants to operate at its highest capacity, it needs to recruit the best staff from across the state.

Traditionally, if the analyst has a big idea, it needs to be approved by the I, the II, the III, the Division Chief, the Deputy Director, the Chief Deputy Director, the Department Director, the Deputy Secretary, the Undersecretary, and the Agency Secretary before it goes to the Governor's Office. That's why this platform is such a vital innovation! Thanks for setting it up, ODI! I'm expecting great things.",

It allows for the utilization of innate talents, skills or the discovery of innate talents, skills.  Everything obtained through this experience should be considered in job hiring and promotional situations.   The skills used on the job should be converted into college credits.  We should be working with our colleges and universities to look into that conversion and offering on-site classes to obtain degrees.  We can fill the empty space in government buildings with college and university classes instead of expanding physical space on campuses.  It would allow students to work closely with professionals in their chosen fields of study easily.  It would allow employees to learn current practices and skills in their positions. Or explore other areas of interest. I think management positions should be renamed Leadership.  Leadership should include management skills but lean heavily on what it means to lead.   Training and development, apprenticeship programs should be required throughout every department. Our workforce should be highly knowledgeable of the department they work for and continuously learning skills.     There could be an organization created of representatives from each department learning about each other, building relationships and working together on specific projects.",

      "content": "Government should design public programs to help communities respond to the needs of their own community members, rather than government programs replacing the way individuals rely on community.  Therefore, every public program should rigorously evaluate the extent to which programs, and the public resources they administer, strengthen real connections between communities, families and individuals who are in need.  One area of policy this idea could be applied to is homelessness services.  Every homeless person has people who love them and want to help them, but there is often no safe way for family and friends to stay connected and engaged.  Government spending should always start from a place of prioritizing ways that it can strengthen/rebuild a vulnerable person's connectivity to their family and community. That could include creating pathways for a caring family member to make financial contributions to a family member struggling with mental illness or addition that are dedicated to housing, to food, to pro-social activities.  Or to create safe environments that are dedicated to helping people in a mental health crisis reconnect to people who love them.  People only heal in the context of community and belonging.  Our programs should prioritize paying for things that rebuild those actual connections.",

This approach not only promotes equity and representation in state service, but also makes our recruitment process more effective by reaching individuals who may not have otherwise considered a career with our department.

The purpose of creating a universal statewide department app is because each department has different information from the business owner. For example, one state department is notified timely that a business has closed or moved to a new location, yet another state department was never notified.  the unversal app solves this problem by streamlining the changes for all departments at once.   Also, the purpose of developing a universal statewide department cellphone app is to ensure  1. Efficiencies in collecting state revenues yet simplifying the process for a small business owner to register for state permits and licenses specifically related to their business.  2. Creating a universal database for state departments to track data.    Then, I would like to see that a QR code is then created for the business owner to use to easily identify themselves and could also be used for all the state permits and licenses held by the business owner.    Account changes to any state permit and licenses like an address change could be handled through this app and that the changes are in real time or within 24-hours.",

It is as if the USA and States are on constant guard about their legitimacy. This type of defensive, militarized, inhumane tone and culture will eventually turn on itself as we see this happening already at federal government levels through tyranny at the executive branch. It is recommended for State Government to evolve from this militarized, inhumane, inconsiderate manner and approach to one that views State Government as part of humanity the people it governs, instead of its ultimate ruler and oppressor. It is recommended that Law enforcement in CA stop accepting federal funds from JAG and Byrne that incentivize the stop and frisk, arrest, search, and imprisonment of their targeted demographic, specifically poor Black and Brown people, who make up most of the arrests, charges, and imprisonment via the War on Drugs. It is recommended to stop the State corruption of profiting off arresting people of any race or gender, imprisoning them, and causing trauma for the rest of their lives. This trauma is seen in mass homelessness as ex-cons are institutionally excluded from jobs or housing. Law enforcement corruption has caused this problem of homelessness in CA.",

This approach would provide instant communication, ensuring that more people especially those without stable mailing addresses can be reached quickly and reliably.  By transitioning to digital access, the public could view, complete, and submit forms electronically rather than relying on traditional mail. This would significantly reduce printing and postage costs, streamline processing, and enhance overall efficiency.  Number of the individuals my department serves are transient due to unstable housing, making electronic communication far more effective than mail. Allowing technology to replace paper-based processes would not only save government resources but also give the public greater control and faster turnaround times when submitting information. Printing and mailing forms require multiple steps and personnel, consuming unnecessary time and resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. For some people,  unnecessary delays and wait time for benefits can be quite catastrophic and we must at least explore a better process so that we can serve the public better.  Perhaps a more obvious one is simply finding a way to increase staffing to reduce backlogs which is significantly impacting the public my agency serves. Staffing shortage is very concerning.",

      "content": "A primary problem is the lack of data integration between state systems that serve California's industries. Businesses are often required to submit the same core information, legal name, address, corporate filings, to multiple, separate departments. This creates a fragmented and inefficient experience for them and for us. This data silo effect forces state employees to spend significant time manually reconciling information from different sources, increases the risk of data entry errors, and prevents us from having a clear, holistic view of industry interactions with the state. Solution:My ideas focus on creating a \"submit once, use many times\" data architecture through two main initiatives: A Unified Business Portal: We should develop a single, secure online portal to serve as the primary digital entry point for any business interacting with the state. A company could manage its profile, permits, and filings in one place, and that verified data would automatically populate across all relevant agency systems. A Standardized Data-Sharing API: To support this, we need to build a modern, secure Application Programming Interface (API). This tool would act as a universal translator, allowing our diverse departmental systems, both legacy and new, to communicate and share common data automatically and securely, eliminating the need for redundant data entry. To make this actionable, we could launch a pilot program integrating the systems of two or three key departments to prove the",

For example, I’ve dedicated personal time to developing a proposal to modernize our departmentwide data infrastructure. I approached this both from the top down—by contributing to department strategic action to re-writing data preservation policy—and from the bottom up—by building user cases that demonstrate practical benefits. On my own, I’ve developed scripts to streamline workflows and integrate processes that were previously manual and siloed.  At the same time, I’ve found it challenging. My proposal for a modern data stack hasn't really 'caught fire' there. In fact, you could say it backfired on me. It didn't ignite innovation; instead, it felt a bit more like – drawing trouble to myself.  Things have pretty much stalled out. It's been a bit frustrating, to be honest – sometimes my ideas get totally sidelined, or I end up doing really repetitive, manual tasks that feel like a step backward.  It’s clear that breaking down silos and advancing modernization is larger than what can be achieved in my current role alone. Still, these experiences reinforce my belief that a more integrated, cloud-based approach would significantly improve efficiency and service delivery across the State.",

Prison Industries, the requirement to purchase furniture from them at often prices exceed 300% more than the same higher quality item for elsewhere. We are forced to pay $700 for a $60 office chair.

State mandated purchasing for high price items also causes appalling markups to costs. Though it may support small business it costs the state an exorbitant amount of money. Because of procurement limitations this essentially forces the state to pay 15-80% more for a product if it’s above $9,999. Our procurement limitations/rules create a massive expense to the state.

I've started my position post pandemic, and the office I've been assigned has 2 other coworkers, which makes the many meetings I have untenable. I cannot concentrate in my office nor can I provide my services with two other calls in the background. Often, I meet with tribals and it feels disrespectful not to be able to give them the privacy they need.   Working in my office also drastically reduces my quality of life. My childcare is in the opposite direction from my office making pick up and drop off a burden. My quite home office allows me to concentrate on work and lowers the stress of my job because I can get my work done. I am healthier because I'm comfortable exercising at home and can make my own lunches.   I joined the state during the pandemic and I have never had trouble building relationships and collaborating with my coworkers. I've successfully been mentored and mentored while working remotely.   I believe that returning to the office will decrease my productivity and that of my fellow coworkers while increasing our stress.",

May be cheaper for the State to have a MS Office license, instead of individual agencies or departments having licenses. Same with ArcGIS, timekeeping software, or anything that multiple State agencies use.   The legislature should also take a close look at what reports they are getting and what they still want. There is an overemphasis on reporting, and many of those reports may not be relevant anymore.   Reform the hiring process. Exams are outdated and do not determine whether someone meets the minimum qualifications, HR does that. The exams often can only be taken over 12 months. What if someone is just a month short of meeting minimum qualifications, but they have to wait a whole year to take the test again? That does not seem fair or equitable.

This role has been absent in my government organizations, and as a result I see a reactive IT force and outdated tools serving the public. Agencies/departments should have such a role to proactively identify opportunities to better meet the mission/serve the public via technology tools; coordinate implementation, drive efficiency, overcome silos, and save on costs. One example: CNRA purchased a GovDelivery contract and negotiated so that all departments could use it - great! But when DPR (Parks) communications adopted it, they did not identify other needs within DPR which was using at least 4 different email services, and they didn't set it up well. The public was signing up for GovDelivery mailing lists that were never used, and some that were being used (i.e. State Parks Commission comms) were still being managed in an Excel spreadsheet list copied into Outlook (yikes). It was poorly implemented and misused because there was no role responsible for identifying the department-wide needs, developing an implementation plan, executing the implementation, training users, and staffing a department-wide administrator to manage the product after launch.",

There are so many steps to complete the most minute tasks, and those tasks seem to be complicated because leadership makes it complicated.  The strict hierarchical approach - at lease from my experience - has just created fear and insecurity about performing daily work.  There isn't an open forum to freely share ideas or talk about new ways of doing things.  We are relegated to a desk manual that is incomplete and doesn't actually allow anyone to think creatively.  I have been assured that every department is not like this, but I have also been told that I work in one of the best departments - so does that mean it's worse out there??  I would LOVE to see more flexibility, mentoring from leaders, allowing for mistakes, and basic access to leaders so we can ask how they got to where they are in the organization.  We look to our leaders for support and guidance.  When they only effort they make is to remind us about our timecards, that's not actually leadership.",

While this may maintain stability, it can also limit innovation and discourage growth among both workers and leaders.  I believe that true leadership development means breaking this cycle and fostering a culture where leaders are empowered to challenge the process, question outdated methods, and seek improvements that benefit both employees and the public we serve. By emphasizing open communication and a willingness to innovate, we can build leaders who not only draw from their experience but also strive to leave systems better than they found them. For me, ‘challenging the process’ is not about disregarding tradition, but about ensuring we continually evolve to meet the needs of Californians with greater efficiency, safety, and accountability.",

Solution: Radical, trailblazing idea to overhaul state service and incentivize employees at all levels. Throw out what you about state service entirely. Clean slate. Ready? Here is the concept: Departments have employment bands. Imagine layered cake - at the bottom is entry-level band, then above that is the supervisor band, the analyst band, manager and, chief band. That is it for positions. Each band incorporates all jobs for those positions. Every 8-12 weeks, staff can rotate to another job - let's call them \"missions\". To move up a band, you have to complete X number of missions and have led X number of missions successfully. Every employee must complete at least 2 missions annually. This kills silos, creates an innovative and growth mindset culture, creates competition, provides constant learning and gamification, etc. Each mission you complete you get a deliverable in hand to show the work you did with a score for your input. There is a list and those with the most missions and missions led, with good scores, are at the top, a constant changing leaderboard. This leaderboard is used to decide who moves up a level when there's an opening. Pay scales with tenure, not position, so you could decide not to move up a band. Folks would need to be focused, quick learners, with high accountability, excellent collaboration... tune in to my next post to see how we find these employees!",

I understand there are all kinds of legal/privacy hurdles we would have to overcome but if someone, including myself, is approved to view all kinds of FTI as is, there is no reason we shouldn't be able to pull data in other departments may have access to in order to make better analytical decisions about our own projects. Just as an example, if I'm working on an analysis to determine how a certain enforcement action may be disproportionately impacting certain subsets of California population, I can examine my own department's data but I cannot compare that to data about California's entire population, so I end up having to look for outside resources provided by private or non-profit sector groups where I can't confirm reliability. That is crazy. If I am working on a data analysis re: insurance settlement payouts, I should be able to easily access information collected by Dept of Insurance instead of having to do a Google search.",

It would be amazing if the state could build more housing for low-income people who work full time, like me!   Allowing people to telecommute is good for the environment, reduces traffic, and increases a department's ability to fill positions. I don't telecommute myself, but I think telecommuting should remain an option. If more people could telecommute, that means they can live anywhere. Spreading out the demand for housing outside of the Silicon Valley, Sacramento, and Los Angeles may help decrease the overall prices in those already congested areas.   The state already owns a lot of land. Build work centers (hoteling?) for state employees in different areas where housing is cheaper. Build employee housing at places like Napa State Hospital to attract good candidates and keep them. We have a high turnover and our employees commute from all over. Our campus is beautiful and we already have our own police and fire department. Build little cottages that employees can rent for a decent price!  Or, provide housing subsidies for state employees who do not earn enough to afford rent in high cost areas.",

Many city and county agencies are far more advanced, provide healthy work-life balances, and provide proper training to management. The little bit of training provided is toxic and our managers are taught poor leadership behaviors. We as adults, are treated like children and are not allowed to have a work-life balance because management uses unfounded information to justify saying no to its employees. We have been told by our management that we are all replaceable and are not valued as employees and this is very disheartening. For our commissioner to feel that way about his staff is demoralizing. This message from the commissioner and management is not going to motivate us or drive performance. As a state employee, I previously valued my work, my team, and the contributions I make every day. Mutual respect would create a healthy work culture, but unfortunately, this attitude from management is creating the opposite effect. No state agency is exempt from the law and exempt from transparency.",

I think we can do better.  A member of the church I attend complained that they sell a publication to several state departments and they have to complete several forms from each department who is interested in purchasing their publication.  Lean Six Sigma is a good continuous improvement methodology tool as well as, total quality management and there are others that might be worth looking into. The State had an external directory and call center.  I like the idea of a Resource Hub for all employees.  We had an Innovation lab at one time.  Be great to have a Statewide lab and Statewide Resource Hub for all State employees.  Mentorship programs come and go. Cross Training that includes T/D (an opportunity to work in a position for training and development for a period of time) should be required of all departments.",

This often involves reducing paperwork, implementing online submission systems, and automating routine tasks. These changes can significantly reduce processing times and improve customer satisfaction.  Implementing Feedback Systems: Establishing robust feedback mechanisms allows departments to gather input from the public and employees. This feedback can be used to identify pain points and areas for improvement. For example, some agencies have introduced regular surveys and suggestion boxes, leading to actionable insights and subsequent process enhancements.  Cross-Training Employees: By cross-training employees, departments can ensure that staff members are versatile and capable of handling multiple roles. This flexibility can lead to more efficient operations, especially during peak times or when there are staff shortages.  Adopting Lean Principles: Lean principles focus on eliminating waste and optimizing workflows. Some state employees have successfully applied these principles to reduce unnecessary steps in processes, leading to faster and more efficient service delivery.

First, there should be increased access to information both internally and externally. Information is power and when we equip individuals with knowledge they may be able to solve problems.   Next, reducing crime and fraud in the State systems. Implementing systems similar to those in the State Fund Special Investigation Unit (SIU) throughout the State in other agencies to spot fraud. Finally, looking for what areas we depend on the Federal Government and begin to reduce that dependency. Chart specifically where we receive the Federal Funding and begin to systematically self fund those areas. If we are not able to self fund look at reductions or creating alternative structures. As the 4th largest economy in the world we should be able to accomplish this task.   Lastly, we need to create a State Insurance model for homeowners, auto and business insurance. We cannot be held hostage to national carriers that cherry pick and can chose to come and go from the California when it suits them. We can model rates and create programs that lead the way of the future in insurance modeling.",

There should be standardized templates that state employees in a buying role can use for their contracts and solicitations. Similar to the CMA Model Template that the CSU and UC universities use. It's a required template used for all contracts and grants with CSUs and UCs. DGS should develop standard templates for contracts and solicitations that can be used by all departments. This would streamline the contracting process tremendously. It creates uniformity, and will increase the review and approval process by departments internal processes, as well as DGS' Procurement Division and Office of Legal Services. It would also impact the prospective contractors that are interested in bidding on our solicitations. If I build an RFP today, it likely looks drastically different from another department's RFP. The content may capture the same info - however, where the information might be found in the solicitation, and the formatting of the solicitation, would be drastically different from others. RFPs can be hundreds of pages, and can be overwhelming for contractors. A standardized contracting template, and a standardized solicitation template for things like RFPs and IFBs - would save the State time and money across the board. DGS, as the business manager for the state, should implement these templates in partnership with other teams.",

      "content": "I think technology and our internal workflows need a major overhaul. I started in January 2025 and was utterly shocked about how far behind we were compared to the rest of the country with business operations. I think our offices could greatly benefit from project management software and/or real customization of our software to makes us more efficient. Our office can't take any other payment other than checks, which sounds crazy to most of the public who walk into the office.  I see a lot of filing and literal paperwork happening in our office and we waste so much time \"looking for files,\" which I feel is a waste of taxpayer dollars when we should be able to find what we need and do our jobs. And while it is great that we have a lot of long-time tenured employees in our ranks, we also need some major training overhauls once these updates are implemented.   I also think training when I started was haphazard at best. No one explained and has not since explained how to properly navigate our manuals, or how to navigate the legal language used. This also deeply surprised me as someone new coming into the state. My expectations was that their training would be top notch. Myself and it sounds like many before me had to teach themselves many topics. Our offices could benefit from streamlined training programs when folks start their positions. Not just about how to be a supervisor, the only training I got, but how to do the actual job and workflows, manuals, concepts, etc.",

The reason is that this environment ultimately better supports external customers. Management should remember that it is their job to ensure staff have the tools and information needed to get their jobs done. Sometimes staff are so bogged down keeping up that they are not current on tools and information. There should be a method for control and release of information to help ensure information is current and only the most current is available for use. Structure minimizes chaos and is sustainable.",

This sounds very similar to Investigators at the Department of Health Care Services, who I learned are required to refer healthcare provider fraud cases exclusively to the CA DOJ for prosecution, harming County DA relationships. I heard Investigators in regulatory agencies (and probably others) work in programs that do not want them to exist, and the program's actions/lack thereof, have not led them to believe they are desired or valued. They also stifle their speech and do not solicit honest feedback. Regarding efficiency, these referral workflows are incredibly inefficient and take months just to pass the case over. Some cases get stale by the time they are delivered then a DOJ agent has to read the case and perform duplicate work to resume investigation.",

A key improvement would be to implement a \"Smart Approval Framework\" that leverages a centralized repository of previously approved use cases. This system would use metadata tagging and AI-driven similarity analysis to identify when a new request closely matches a previously approved one. If a match is found, the system could auto-recommend fast-track approval, reducing redundant reviews.   This would not only accelerate execution but also promote consistency, reduce workload on review boards, and encourage reuse of proven solutions—ultimately driving more agile and responsive public service delivery.",

This helps identify gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement. Once those gaps are clear, I prioritize the areas that can have the greatest positive impact, and then design the future state around those priorities. For example, in leading the upcoming migration of the DHCS website from SharePoint to WordPress, I created a detailed journey map of the contributor workflow. This revealed where contributors were experiencing friction, such as redundant review steps and inconsistent remediation processes. By documenting these pain points, I was able to propose streamlined workflows, standardized training, and clearer content governance, improvements that will make the publishing process more efficient and the website more user-friendly.   Improved Version: Whoever is leading this effort should begin with discovery, connecting with department heads to understand their goals and priorities. From there, work together to build a shared vision for the future of California. Once that vision is established, you can integrate the issues and solutions identified from the ground up. This creates a two-way approach: bottom-up insights from staff and top-down alignment from leadership, which can then be captured in a cohesive diagram of the future state.",

It's unfortunate that government gets in the way of them being successful when at the same time government is bragging about how much they're helping them.",

      "content": "One of the most difficult things about working for the State as a healthcare employee is having decisions made at headquarters in Sacramento that directly affect the lives of the people that I serve, often to their detriment, made by individuals who do not ever meet our clients or understand what they need. Decisions made by a top-down hierarchy often are made with administrators or managers in mind, and I think it should be the other way around. The primary role of a state worker is to serve the public, but often I feel that I am following regulations that are contradictory, don't make sense, or are needlessly burdensome at the expense of my clients for the sake of placating headquarters. I would want fewer top-down decisions; for leaders at headquarters to spend more time at the worksites they direct and oversee, to interact with the people who live there, and to pay closer attention to their needs and input; and more open communication from our leaders about what they are doing to address the concerns that we and our clients bring to them. Another piece that I think deserves a review is the State's policy of going with the lowest bidder for purchasing. Oftentimes, we get what we pay for, and products and services from the lowest bidders are also the lowest quality. There at least should be another metric we go by in addition to price, such as taking into consideration product reviews or how responsive a vendor is to customer needs.",

      "content": "Over the years I have identified two major inefficiencies in stat service: siloing and mismanagement. Siloing leads to duplication of effort across state government. When we conduct duplicative engagements with external audiences, it wastes their time and makes clear that we aren't coordinating internally the way we should. Collaboration and breaking down silos would lead us to be more efficient and make better use of expertise within and across agencies and departments.   Mismanagement is another very common problem I observe in state service. There are very few effective managers who support and empower staff to do their work effectively. Others are either totally checked out and non-responsive, or are some of the worst micromanagers I have ever encountered. So many times I see the state put forth goals for improving state service that ignore these issues. Hiring the right people won't matter if they don't get the support they need to do the work. Managers and supervisors need training to help them develop self-awareness, recognize signs of mismanagement in themselves, and grow to become supports rather than barriers for their staff.",

The state has tried different ways to organize the hierarchy but what we really need is a park manager in charge of each park and the programmatic leads giving guidance for each programmatic area. What we have now are people doing multiple jobs to fill needs. Since that isn't recognized on their duty statement, they are not recognized on paper for it when applying for other positions. They also aren't recognized for it with any pay increase. This creates a very low morale and discourages people to stay within state parks, as they aren't recognized for the work they had to do to keep operations going. So many parks operate off of nonprofit partners, meaning ones without them are left with very few staff working far above their pay. It also creates a huge discrepancy in parks with areas with wealthy donors to nonprofits and parks in low-income areas.",

This isn’t innovation—it’s inertia.  Take the push to return employees to the office four days a week. That’s a straightforward directive, but it sidesteps the harder, more meaningful challenge: making departments truly more efficient. It’s easier to mandate physical presence than to rethink workflows, modernize systems, or confront outdated bureaucratic habits.  The pandemic was a once-in-a-generation disruption that forced us to reevaluate how we work. It showed us that change is possible—and sometimes necessary. Yet instead of building on that momentum, many agencies are retreating to old norms. That’s not just a missed opportunity; it’s a failure to evolve.  The most urgent transformation we need isn’t logistical—it’s cultural. We must shift from a mindset of comfort and repetition to one of curiosity, accountability, and continuous improvement. Real progress begins when we stop asking, “How do we get back to normal?” and start asking, “How do we build something better?”",

For example, we typically have one biologist assigned to cover 2-3 counties in the Bay Area. That single biologist is responsible for managing thousands of acres of CDFW lands, responding to human-wildlife conflict incidents in the counties they cover, AND monitoring/studying various taxa of wildlife, whether it be threatened and endangered species on our lands or game species. The vast majority of the time, we receive calls from the public about injured wildlife or smaller wildlife that are stuck in netting or fences, etc., and we do not have the level of staff or resources to address such calls. Which leaves the public asking: \"If animal services won't address this and you guys can't address it, then who will?\" To which the answer is, sadly: nobody. We used to have temporarily funded conflict wildlife staff who could help address such calls - and we do not have them anymore - and our wildlife and public affected by such wildlife suffer the consequences - and it doesn't make the Department look good when we aren't able to address such calls on a more regular basis.  We also need to have a much better presence on social media and spend more time educating the public",

Working in hiring, I do understand that just because someone is an OA and their next step would typically be OT doesn't mean that they don't qualify for an SSA or AGPA, skipping steps or maybe even a whole other possible route of executive secretary or way more. With this being said, I think this is why there is not what we are seeking. I think it would be too broad of a spectrum, especially since there are so many different qualifications for each position. I have been asking for years and have gotten the run around by multiple agencies. I would keep asking questions, network with others, speak to other people in and out of your department. Maybe speak to your department manager about your concerns and see what can be done about it. I always encourage my employees to come to me with their concerns, with a solution and be the change. We can always develop and be a better agency but without voicing it, we will never get better. I wish you the best in your career as a new state employee.",

Faced with unprecedented challenges, we didn’t just adapt—we transformed.  We accelerated the digitization of our processes, shifting away from paper-heavy workflows and outdated systems. This wasn’t just about convenience; it was about survival. By streamlining operations and cutting through layers of bureaucracy, we empowered teams to do their jobs more effectively and with greater autonomy.  We also introduced flexibility for employees—something that had long been resisted. Remote work options, flexible schedules, and trust in individual accountability led to a noticeable boost in morale. People felt seen, respected, and more engaged.  Perhaps most importantly, we reimagined how we communicate within the department. Barriers broke down, silos dissolved, and collaboration became more fluid. These weren’t temporary fixes—they were foundational changes that made us stronger, more responsive, and more human. But unfortunately, all this under threat with mindset of we have go back to office and return of the old way of doing things mindset",

I would recommend an audit of all BU 9 duty statements to determine if a license is actually required to do the job.   I say this because I have seen the state increase the use of \"licensed\" BU 9 staff when a license is not necessary to complete the work. DGS' Division of the State Architect, the Building Standards Commission, and the Office of Sustainability, as well as CalTrans previously hired non-licensed employees to complete the work that does not require a license.   However, in the past decade these Departments/Divisions/Commissions have stopped using classifications that do require a license. The problem is that the work required by these entities can be completed by a combination of licensed and unlicensed staff, but by hiring only licensed staff, the state is wasting hundreds-of millions of dollars.   A licensed architect/engineer gets paid (after benefits) $250k/year or more. An unlicensed person doing the work that doesn't require a license gets paid $150k/year. Multiply that $100k/year savings by the thousands of staff at DGS and CalTrans that are paid for their license but don't perform license-level work.  By hiring unlicensed staff to do the unlicensed work, there is also an opportunity for the state to recruit and maintain staff.   But STOP paying licensed BU 9 staff to do work that non-licensed staff can do. It will save the state at least 1/2 a billion dollars.",

It makes it better for Californians, but also for those processing the paperwork. When people understand, the whole process goes smoother, even if the reason you have to fill out the form is frustrating. This doesn't mean dumbing things down, but thinking about them deeply to make sure we convey exactly what we need and removing any excess fluff. This takes a lot of thought, because it requires us to question why we are doing something, why we are asking other people to do things, and whether the current process really gets us there, in practice and not just in theory. It takes more work upfront, and can take some convincing, but it's really just applying a \"measure twice, cut once\" mentality to work. I've seen staff workload get lighter as a result, freeing them to do more in other areas (especially ones they're interested in). I work with a historically difficult demographic and I've seen these methods systematically repair our relationship with this population, making our work easier, but also allowing us to build on those improvements.

For example, an individual who qualifies for Medi-Cal and Medicare who wants to qualify for the MasterCare assisted living program needs to work with county Medi-Cal, their insurance, and a healthcare organization, and MasterCare to enjoin their insurance to access benefits.",

The Problem - For services that require an in-person visit, like at the DMV, residents often must take significant time off work to wait in a physical line, sometimes for hours. This is lost time and productivity for the public, and it creates crowded, stressful office environments. The Solution: Implement and standardize a digital queuing system for all high-volume state service centers. Using a mobile app or website, a Californian could join the line for a specific service remotely. See their real-time estimated wait time. Receive a notification when it's their turn to head to the physical office. This tool-based solution respects the resident's time by turning hours of passive waiting into productive time they can use at home or work. It makes the experience vastly more efficient and user-friendly.",

Solution 2 - Set standard subject lines for Department/Statewide emails to better filter them to email folders. E.g. use \"Job Posting\" at the beginning of the subject for any kind of new or backfill positions being advertised.  Issue 3 - Reasonable Accommodation (RA) process. Solution 3 - Allow 1st or 2nd level supervisors/managers to determine RA approval, and not have it go to headquarters.  IF denied, then the employee should have the option to push it up the chain.  HQ is a bottleneck and some folks have to wait 6 months or more for approval.  Issue 4 - Inflexible Telework Solution 4 - Allow more flexibility of telework schedule by having 1st or 2nd level supervisor/manager to determine viability of telework for the position and the schedule (required in office vs. remote time), instead of one size fits all coming from headquarters or statewide.  Issue 5 - Most forms not e-sign ready Solution 5 - Convert electronic forms to be e-sign ready instead of requiring convoluted procedures to \"flatten\" them.",

This is a LLM (Large Language Model) utilizing only documents that have been curated.

Practical Implementation Notes:  Start Small: Begin with one grant program (maybe Perkins V) to prove concept and refine algorithms Data Integration First: The auto-population from existing systems is crucial - RAG works best when it has complete, accurate data Change Management: Frame this as \"freeing staff to focus on helping districts succeed\" rather than \"replacing human judgment\" Transparency: Make the AI decision logic completely visible to districts - they should understand exactly why they were approved/denied",

      "content": "I work for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).  One of the largest financial burdens of this department is the amount of movement made for inmates (i.e. transfers from one prison to a different prison).  Specifically, when an inmate's mental health level of care is changed to a \"higher\" level of care (i.e. to EOP, ICF, Acute, MHCB), the inmate is transferred \"short-term\" to a different prison.  This transfer takes multiple Correctional Officers driving across the state to take the inmate from Point A to Point B.  As the Mental Health level of care is temporary, they are transferred back (or to a new prison) within a short period of time.  The same inmates are transferred many times throughout the year, whenever their Mental Health changes.   In my opinion, it would be cheaper, more cost effective, and more efficient, if each prison had the appropriate staff at that prison to treat that inmate's mental health level of care. So... don't transfer the inmate from Point A to Point B multiple times; keep the inmate at Point A, and have on-site staff treat the inmate.    This would be a huge cost savings.",

This imbalance contributes to low tenure and retention within the classification, especially in higher-cost regions.  If the state were to establish automatic stipends or geographic pay adjustments, similar to those used by the federal government and based on GSA locality rates, it could make these positions more competitive and appealing to prospective candidates. This approach would support workforce stability, improve retention, and help ensure statewide operational readiness across all regions.",

However, I believe there needs to be big steps, innovative steps taken to do the business of government differently and better.  This takes teams of employees.  We then become \"we\" instead of the \"I\".  We are public servants and in my opinion should work together to fulfill the needs of the public which means we need to create a culture that enables each employee to be encouraged, to bring their talents, skills and experience to the table.  We need more pathways to promote so employees dont feel stuck or having to take a position not well suited for the pay increase..  I think we need to look at the successes of other state departments, maybe city and county departments within California, maybe the Federal government, of other states and even other countries, public entities (corporations, nonprofits etc).  What about other leadership styles, combining ones that will work for us.  If you are not in a management or exec position it is hard if not impossible to make or submit suggestions for changes that are considered and implemented.  So, that might mean creating a situation requiring input, actional input, decision involvement from staff level employees up.  That situation would mean replacing managers with leaders and a culture supporting involvement throughout the department.",

If California truly wants to reduce its carbon footprint, the solution isn’t to force everyone into electric cars, it’s to reduce the need for cars and commuting altogether. REMOTE WORK is the future. It cuts emissions, lowers costs, and allows employees to be more productive while leaving face-to-face gatherings for when they matter most, social and collaborative purposes. The Governor’s RTO order ignores both technology and the cost-saving benefits that remote work provides. It especially harms employees with disabilities who cannot safely or reasonably commute, even though they have already proven they can perform their jobs effectively from home. California should lead by example and show that sustainability starts with the state workforce, by embracing remote work, not resisting it.",

With the transition to ZEVs, why can't these WEX cards be used at EV charging stations?  Especially Tesla?  Departments must either have a separate credit card number to provide employees on their Tesla app, which then subjects the card to misuse and unauthorized non-state purchases, or employees must use their own personal credit cards and then submit a travel expenditure claim to request reimbursement.  If a WEX card could be used to charge an EV, it would be so much easier for state staff and less work for accounting staff to manage multiple cards, process travel claims, and management to review and approve so many different payment mechanisms.  If the WEX card could also be expanded to be used for small repairs and oil changes, staff wouldn't need to spend so much time finding a repair shop that will accept state payment policies, and can also get repairs done much faster without downtime.",

For staff that still must come into the office for a legitimate in person requirement (processing mail, etc), multiple departments can consolidate into existing State owned buildings.  The Franchise Tax Board campus would be a great place to consolidate these staff.  There are multiple buildings to house different departments with free parking.  Staff that get to telework 100% would be much happier and more productive at work and at home.  It was proven to work during the pandemic.  There was never a problem with full time telework and it didn't need to go away.  Staff in positions that can't telework would have something to strive for in future positions.  The State government would be able to obtain the best talent away from the private sector and offer a new incentive to work for the government.  Taxpayers would be happy to see the cost savings.  I suppose the only people unhappy with full time telework would be urban business owners.  It is said that urban areas hurt when people telework.  But there are winners and losers in everything in life.  For every downtown business owner that is unhappy, there is a business owner in the suburbs that is getting more business.

While there are a ton of dedicated and competent employees, there are also those that utilize the protections afforded to public employees and those in unions to not meet even minimum potential. To solve this problem, I think we should ensure that employees and supervisors are being periodically checked in on. I have had three roles within the state government since 2021 and have never had a performance review or worked with a supervisor on a plan for trainings or moving forward in my career. I also think supervisors should undergo a 720 degree review - where they are appraised by their supervisors, employees, and themselves.",

      "content": "One issue that deserves more attention is the disconnect between state employee compensation and the rising cost of living across many regions in California.  While I understand that salaries can improve over time through merit-based increases in line with the classifications pay scale, the reality is that many state positions, some of which require degrees and several years of relevant experience, start out with compensation that is classified as low income under both state and federal income limits in numerous counties. These are not entry level roles, yet the starting pay often does not reflect the level of responsibility, expertise, or the cost of living in the areas we serve.  Public service is deeply meaningful and essential work. Most of us do not enter this field with the expectation of becoming rich. However, when experienced professionals are struggling to meet basic living expenses, it creates an external burden that can impact their ability to perform at their highest potential. Financial stress can affect focus, morale, and long-term retention, ultimately impacting the quality of service we provide to the public.  Addressing this issue would not only support the well-being of dedicated employees but also strengthen the effectiveness and sustainability of our workforce. Investing in fair and competitive compensation is an investment in the quality and continuity of public service.",

I get distracted at work because anyone can walk by my desk and start a conversation which then distracts me from my work.

This creates challenges such as:  Struggling to afford gas going into offices more than 2xs a week. Commuting long distances (adding stress and reducing work -life balance), difficulty retaining skilled employees in state service, overall increased pressure on mental and financial well-being.  Solution would be to retain the 2 day a week in office work schedule for state employees without negotiating a reduction in pay in exchange (2026).

People learn differently, but as a manager, I noticed that more of my new hires come out of their virtual training confused and unclear about the topics that were covered.  Some really don't appreciate the electronic platform because it's impersonal and doesn't allow them to feel engaged in the lesson.  I also find that the electronic platforms do not offer the opportunity for networking, which is so valuable as you move on in your career.  I also find a lot of these trainings are being cut too short.  My employees don't feel like they are being given the opportunity to really retain the information, which only sets them up for failure.  I am a \"hands-on\" learner myself, and so when my new hires tell me that they would have liked to physically handle some of the example processes, instead of virtually working through them, I can completely empathize with that.  New hires are going out into their offices and causing even more exhaustion and congestion amongst those that already know the job and are trying to slow down enough to help the new hires catch up.  I find that there is much more \"on-the-job\" training needed, but we are already so stressed for workers that this causes a major inconvenience for the office to have to pick up the slack where the training is lacking.   Conclusion: Bring back classrooms for \"beginner\" classes and elect dedicated mentors for new hires.",

Emergency is the key word. When California is having natural or manmade disasters, emergency operations are bogged down by the control agencies that make the rules for spending. In my 37 years of experience in emergency response, the biggest hurdle in mitigating an emergency is the handcuffs placed on the response by the control agencies. When the control agencies are in the room with a seat at the table, they can't even figure out how to navigate through their own bureaucracy. I have personally had to remind them that they made the rule, they can change it. The control agencies need to sit with SMEs from response agencies and ask them how to make the processes more effective and efficient. We need people that want to collaborate and make positive changes, not just because it's the way it's been done for ever. California is the leader in emergency response and in many cases in the world, but we are handicapped by our archaic processes mandated by the control agencies.",

It is up to the managers and past employees (if you're fortunate enough to be enlightened by their strategies) to aide us on how to complete our job in the most efficient manner. To that I'd like to state that when an employee promotes, transfers, or leaves CDCR completely, there is no overlapping of employment of the predecessor and successor for training. When an employee assumes a position for the first time, that employee must learn to govern themselves. They must teach themselves to be efficient and make the most out of their time. With that said, I think all employees have had to invent ways or utilize methods to ensure efficiency, whether self-taught or passed down from their predecessor- nothing is put in place to give employees direction on best practices to ensure work is completed in a tried-and-true efficient manner. There is nothing for employees to utilize and build on to tailor it for their institution specific duties. Employees are overall responsible for how their day is managed and it can highlight ones' drive to do well or not and can increase turnover rates.",

For lack of expertise in state positions, low paying and low qualification positions see high turnover. In administrative units we lose someone with years of knowledge and experience so that they can promote. That person is worth more in their current position with the knowledge they have amassed. If they are eligible to apply to a higher administrative position, they should be eligible to promote in place. The high turnover makes state processes extremely slow as we wait for someone to be trained or wait for the position to be filled.   For outdated minimum qualifications, an example is the Water Resource Control Engineer position. It requires a limited type of degree from a limited set of schools, yet engineers at other agencies (such as CalTrans, air resources, CalFire, etc.) allow for engineers that have an EIT and are on the licensing path (which is allowed by the Board of Licensing for engineers). This limits our pool of qualified candidates, when there are licensed civil engineers who cannot be hired because of outdated qualifications. Circling back, the process to even get this looked at is slow because of admin unit turnover and lack of expertise.",

Remote work allows for flexibility, and quality of life.  No, we are not spending all day doing household chores but we are spending the time that we would otherwise be commuting doing our family duties.  Commuting is a waste of our time.  Packing breakfast and lunch every day is a waste of our time.  Picking clothes to wear to work is a waste of time.  When the work day ends, we want to be home with the family not on the road.  Commuting is congestion, pollution and stressful to our health.  The building developers can figure out how to fill their vacancies on their own.  The restaurant owners can figure out how to serve more customers in the private industry.  These cannot be reasons end remote work for state workers.  As a remote worker, I have time to wake up and exercise, drink my tea, coffee or smoothie in peace and not in the car driving and make a healthy breakfast to get my day started.  It allows personal time in the morning that cannot be enjoyed while commuting.  For the state employees who take advantage of teleworking, they need to be held accountable for their work by their supervisors.  Don't take away telework for everyone.  For those who meet with the public, they don't get to telework.  It's that simple.  My building has been vandalized multiple time s and we had to go home because of no water.

I have to applaud them for finally modernizing. Coming from the private sector to the public sector, I was able to bring many updated IT processes to the multiple departments that I've worked for, but nothing has been more effective and efficient than decentralization of our teams and workgroups through technology like Teams, SharePoint and other connectivity programs that allow us to more efficiently work outside of an office and keep productivity locked to a single location. This is how things have to change to keep pace with the modern world; CA government needs to embrace the change from a militaristic bureaucracy with \"butts in seats\" policies and a \"because I told you so,\" leadership style, to a collaborative team environment that allows everyone to do their best work from where they work best.",

I often hear people say \"I'm not a computer person\" whenever they come across something they don't understand or have an issue with. I don't think this is an acceptable mentality when over 90% of their job is on the computer! I'm not asking them to troubleshoot everything but I would like to see some effort in at least Googling how to fix minor issues like adjusting a view in Outlook or their display settings.  Here's a few other common things I've encountered.  -Not knowing how to shut down a computer or the difference between shutting down, restarting, sleep, and closing the lid. -What file explorer is and how to navigate network folders. -How to use the search (Windows key) to find stuff. -How to connect to the WIFI and VPN.  That is why I think we need some sort of basic computer literacy exam before people can apply for a job. Maybe add it as a component in CalCareers.  Another big problem I see is paper waste. We spend so much money on printers/faxes, and supplies when most things could just be a PDF. In my dept, I think we spent over a million on a filing system that can be moved electronically.",

I would like to see trainings structured more like college courses where there are not just multiple choice knowledge checks but reviewed responses to open ended questions at several stages in the learning process, and work completed for review, feedback, and revision. I'm guilty of sometimes phoning in a training myself but I also take time to continue my education and I take pride in my work. Not everyone does and then I have to explain to them why or how what they've submitted is incorrect or incomplete. That is not always appreciated and I shouldn't have to train folks that are my superior or at my same level. Also, I would like to see us not use AI very much as it will enable these folks to continue not knowing what they are doing.

Every year for the last 5 years people is moving due to these prices going higher every year. I have kids and family to take care of and when I have to go get another job when working at the state level there is a problem. There used to be a saying that if we got into the state we would be set to be able to live comfortably and provide for our loved ones and that's not true anymore. When I get a raise, something always goes up and takes it from me as if I never got it. To be able to buy anything whether house or car they are taxed to the roof and prices never go down. If they do something else goes up. California needs to be affordable to be able to thrive, more policing, and use of more natural resources that California has had for decades. You ask what ideas I have to solve these problems I address, well start thinking like the bottom person and American citizens of this state that are struggling to eat and live and put policies that create more jobs, businesses, and programs that help people. Less to those that don't deserve handouts or free assistance on the taxpayer's dime. Thank you",

I take pride in helping individuals and teams discover their 'Why' both personally and organizationally. Therefore, they can connect with their purpose, love what they do, and ultimately make a greater impact. Supporting others in finding that clarity and alignment is incredibly fulfilling, and it’s what drives me every day. My personal Why is to make my grandma proud.   To make California’s government more effective and efficient, we need to prioritize human connection in the workplace. By creating safe spaces, motivating our employees, developing their skills, and consistently reminding them of the value they bring, we empower them to become the best version of themselves. When employees feel valued and cared for, they perform better, contribute more meaningfully, and help build a stronger, more effective government. I believe in dreaming big, staying positive, and starting small, because small actions often lead to the biggest impact.  Yes, I’ve seen and contributed to more effective and efficient service within the State. One example from my own work involves helping departments align their workforce and succession planning efforts with their organizational goals. By guiding teams to identify their “Why” and connect it to their mission, we’ve improved employee engagement and clarity of purpose.",

The absence of real-time data on revenues and expenses may make it challenging for lawmakers, control agencies and constituents to manage/adjust their budgets based on the latest info.    SOLUTION  Create an online visual tool with real-time data of sources of funds (from CDTFA, FTB, etc.) and uses of funds (to the General Fund, special funds, and locals).   This would enable lawmakers, control agencies and the public to have a better understanding of the current financial state of revenues and expenses overall as well as to individual programs. A real-time (perhaps updated weekly) tool should also enable the State to better forecast revenues, expenses and surplus/shortfalls.",

This  is an imperfect term that I use here as a catchall for systemic misogyny, racism, and ableism that promotes \"rugged individual\" myth. There needs to be a major culture shift in our approach to governance and resource management that would allow all people to participate in government. An inclusive government will more effectively serve all Californian's by promoting discussion and rational thinking over our current \"follow the strongman\" model. This survey feels like a box checking exercise that leadership can use a proof that they asked for input that will not be acted upon. State leadership would benefit from cultural humility training, however, it will take generations to bring about the cultural shift necessary to cause meaningful change. The State of California needs to own its racist actions, past and present. We need to acknowledge that we became the fourth largest economy through genocide, exploitation, and unsustainable resource extraction that continues today, and only benefits a few. Most state employees are ignored, especially scientists who point out that our resource extraction is unsustainable, and racial equity practitioners who point out how our racist policies are hurting oppressed communities. We need to stop being defensive and own our wrongdoing. We cannot solve a problem if we continually deny it's existence.",

Strong managers use the STD 638 to offer the truly earned feedback, where mediocre managers often rank everyone as \"M\" and provide little, if any,  constructive feedback there or in day-to-day interactions. For those who have been over-achievers all of our lives, to have a mediocre manager provide this is frustrating and off-putting. Encourage managers to work hard on these as this engagement will motivate staff, support professional growth and ensure that high performers feel valued. Less effective managers tend to provide only average or generic reviews, even for excellent employees, without offering guidance on how they can advance. This lack of feedback discourages staff and can hinder development. Additionally, promotions should be based on demonstrated leadership qualities rather than circumstance. A stronger vetting process is needed to ensure promotions go to those who consistently model dedication and performance. HR should also allow and encourage higher rankings for employees who truly give 110%. When staff exceed expectations but their reviews do not accurately reflect their effort, it creates deep frustration and drives talented employees to consider leaving for agencies where their contributions will be recognized. By strengthening both the feedback process and evaluation system, the organization can better retain top talent and truly promote a culture of excellence.",

As a result of the 'See something, say something' DHS directive, this protection emboldens people to speak up and say something when they encounter any kind of corrupt or false statement or action, whether small or large, whether discovered immediately or in the future. The importance of protecting whistleblowers will help to improve and maintain work culture, safety, and integrity. When state workers feel safe, protected, and heard, those they govern in the State of CA will also feel the same. This work of maintaining civility, integrity, and morale, starting at the State government level, will positively ripple outwards in maintaining a culture of civility, integrity, and morale for the residents of California as well. As the State of CA is a leader amongst USA states, this example, if executed successfully will help the other states who are influenced by the State of CA. This ripple effect could influence a positive outcome for the USA, as it currently suffers from a rapid decline in civility, integrity, and morale.",

      "content": "The State, in general, is quite inefficient.  Having spoken with many relatives and friends who are employed with the State in various different departments and agencies, there is simply not enough work assigned to each employee.  For example, employees are assigned a weekly workload that are able to be accomplished within a day or less and as a result, employees have nothing to do for the remainder of the week.  This may be caused by the fact that there are excessive number of employees assigned to a specific project/assignment/role.  Employees who speak up to seek more work are often frowned upon because their peers do not want to be assigned more work.  Employees who are comfortable with their low workload would not speak up (and sometimes even exaggerate how \"busy\" they are) in order to preserve their low workload.  As a hard-working State employee and a California taxpayer, I believe the State needs to do a thorough time study to evaluate the amount of work being performed by State employees and determine if there is sufficient workload assigned to employees before considering to hire more people.  Highly recommend that the time study is conducted by auditors or a third-party and not conducted internally or \"self-assessed\" workload analysis because there will be inherent biases.",

This includes both permanent and part-time employees. Everyone gets the same opportunities and everyone is a lead on one or more project. This also helps to distribute knowledge across the team. I also focus a lot on professional development. I make sure to discuss professional goals on an annual basis and then I assign projects to help them meet those goals. I invite staff into meetings with management, so they can get face-to-face interactions with them and so that they can learn and understand some of the processes of our agency. This has all led to better efficiency, accuracy, succession planning, job satisfaction, and staff retention.",

Managers spend a lot of time correcting timesheets and answering questions about leave balances, instead of working on program goals.  I suggest enhancing the Cal Employee Connect platform at SCO, to identify what payroll codes stand for and how to use them. For example someone could hover over the \"HOL ITO\" and a pop up would appear that spelled out what the code means, and state either how to use it, or link to information about how to use it.  The entry for \"PH\" has an information symbol that states, \"This entry is measured in Units and must be used in full Units increments.\"  This is helpful to know, but many employees may not know what \"Units\" or \"full Units increments\" means. \"Units\" is capitalized, indicating there is a definition somewhere, but that information has to be hunted down. While I can find this information, it would save me time if employees could easily find this information themselves, and understand how to use the different leave categories, at the same time as checking their leave balances. While the information is out there, it could be provided in a much more user friendly/smarter way.  I'll add that Cal Employee Connect is already a great platform. I think it can get even better.",

QRP's should have a ladder.  QRP I: Master's degree non-associate.  QRP II - Associate (ASW, AMFT, APCC). QRP III - IV Licensed professional (under 2 years (III), or more than 2 years (V). There is no reason to group differently qualified QRPs together and we will lose talent without the opportunity for clinical advancement.  Additionally, we need licensed people at each site.  The acuity is too high for just MSWs or CRCs.  We need clinical expertise and support of that expertise in VR settings. Unfortunately, our executive leadership does not have the clinical lens or skill set to validate the importance of this need.",

During a disaster, such as the Mammoth Snow Incident, The January Fires (2025), and the Texas Flooding (EMAC-HR K9 MRP), Traditional purchasing methods like purchase orders or contracts are to slow and can endanger public health, safety, and property.  Acquisition outside of normal business hours: Disaster often occurs at unexpected times, such as nights and weekends. CAL-Cards provide a payment mechanism that functions at all hours when supplies are available. Elimination of red tape: The Emergency Response CAL-Card ERC (Emergency Response CAL-Card) program is specifically designed to cut through bureaucracy for disaster response. It is intended for use after the Governor’s Office has issued a disaster proclamation and when other payment mechanisms are unavailable. Flexibility with vendors: Unlike standard purchasing, the ERC (Emergency Response CAL-Card) has a broad allowance for merchant categories, giving card holders the flexibility to purchase from vendors that are accessible and have the needed supplies and services during emergencies. Recommendation: Authorize and issue CAL-Cards to all Special Operations Assistant Chiefs to: •\tFacilitate immediate procurement of mission-critical items during deployments and pre-positions •\tSupport fiscal accountability and streamline reimbursement processes •\tEnhance operational autonomy for A-REPs managing complex field operations",

If we merely asked employees not to put anything smelly in their trash (place it in the kitchen trash to be emptied daily), the janitors could empty the office wastewater baskets weekly. Or, as CalEPA does, each person is responsible for emptying their trash, as needed, in a central hallway receptacle and the janitors merely empty that one, as well as the separate receptacles in the kitchen (compost, recycling and landfill) on a daily basis.",

      "content": "As a state employee, I am writing to propose an innovative idea to standardize specific statewide policies across all departments. Currently, many departments independently develop similar policies in operational, human resources, and administrative areas. Centralizing these policies would create significant efficiencies and result in substantial resource and cost savings.  This proposal includes leveraging technology to automate this process where feasible, developing comprehensive templates, and providing statewide training to ensure consistent implementation across all departments. It is recommended that the state centralize this effort for all general policies within the California Department of Human Resources.  Additionally, there is some statewide centralization for Information Technology (IT) and security policies. However, IT and security policies should be reviewed to identify if there are more opportunities for centralization. While many IT and security policies are proprietary, there may be areas where streamlining is possible. Statewide IT and security policies should continue to be centralized within the California Department of Technology.",

Once complete, the form should be sent to the agency requesting it. Agencies should also be able to assign forms to employees to complete. Staff should be able to log in to this account and view every form submitted. A system like this should be available to all citizens in California so they don't need to type their name, address, etc., on every form to access services.",

      "content": "One issue I have consistently encountered is the challenge of working with state procured contractors, especially in programs that involve direct public service like case management.  In my experience, onboarding and training contractors can be time consuming, and often their staff do not fully understand program policies or the scope of work. This can lead to inconsistent messaging and confusion for the Californians we serve. Many of these vendors are also based out of state and may not fully grasp the unique needs of our communities.  I believe we should explore bringing more of this work in house. For example, having state employees handle case management could improve consistency, accountability, and transparency. It would also allow us to better control outcomes, reduce excessive billing, and build internal capacity by developing staff skill sets.  While contractors can play a role, I think a more balanced approach with a stronger in-house presence would ultimately lead to better service delivery and public trust.",

Rationale:  Inefficient use of resources: Current CDT oversight adds layers of redundant review and documentation that consume millions in staff hours and consulting costs, without measurably improving project success rates.  Delays delivery: The additional procurement checkpoints extend timelines, often by several months, discouraging innovation and responsiveness.  Limited accountability: Oversight bodies rarely bear responsibility when projects fail, creating a misalignment between authority and accountability.  Alternative Approach: Shift to agency-led, outcome-based accountability:  Empower departments to own their projects end-to-end, while holding them accountable, to iterate, hold departments accountable, for cost, schedule, and performance.  Replace CDT’s checklist-style oversight with independent milestone reviews (e.g., external auditors or peer agency reviews) tied to measurable deliverables.  Adopt modular, milestone-based procurement (similar to private sector best practices) that enables course correction without massive sunk costs.  Expected Impact: Faster project initiation, lower administrative overhead, clearer accountability, and better use of taxpayer dollars.",

We always look to reducing staff costs when the state budget is tight. The way we staff our smaller departments is not resilient and the shocks are killing us. As a result, analyst work has been pushed up to supervisory/management levels, because the available staff to do analyst work is getting smaller and smaller. I'm hoping that the reclassification of the analyst series on will help, but it won't fix it. AI and technology solutions can provide some help, but they do not replace thinking people. You want to know why there is no decent onboarding, or written procedures, just learn what you can? Why so many grievances? Why it's so hard to learn state contracting or Fi$Cal? Why no updated policy or streamlined procedures?  Why duty statements are over 10 years old? Why no innovation? Because the mid-level leadership and front line analysts  that would be part of the team that develops those things, that can point out the real problems in the system, can only do day-to-day survival tasks, jumping from fire to fire. We have positions that are vacant for months b/c of budget, the work is spread out over fewer and fewer burnt-out staff, then we lose those positions because they were vacant. Succession planning is nice but staffing resilience and system capacity would be better.",

I work for CDCR and I have observed some areas where improvements can be made.  From my anecdotal observations, we have a poor hiring process for managers and tend to promote people into management roles without the skills, knowledge or abilities to be a manager. I noticed we promote those who may have good supervisory skills into management roles, but not necessarily management skills.  I would prefer CDCR to look outside the department to staff management roles. We currently tend to have an unofficial requirement to come \"up the ranks\" to staff management positions when getting someone \"off the streets\" may be of better value as a manager. Supervisors and staff must be technical experts; managers need to manage.   Additionally, we tend to undervalue education in this department. I believe having a relevant education should be strongly considered for promotion. Many studies have proven the value of education, and I never understood why CDCR's hiring practices put no value in having an education. If I were able to make the decision, I would require a BS degree and experience to be interviewed for a management position.  I am not implying all of CDCR's managers are horrible people, but I have observed a lack of critical thinking and poor management skills with many of them.",

If this option were available for those who choose to work at home this would save the state in hundreds of thousands in salaries per year.

My suggestion is to allow for more open forums on what programs the public actually wants and needs to best serve them, and then make sure those programs are more well thought out before implementing.",

On one hand, there is a strong emphasis on rewarding current civil service experience, while on the other, external candidates are expected to meet disproportionately high educational and experiential thresholds. For instance, some classifications equate one year of state service to a master’s degree plus three years of professional experience. This raises a critical question: how can a single year of internal service be considered equivalent to such extensive academic and professional preparation? This practice not only undermines the value of formal education and diverse professional backgrounds but also creates systemic barriers for qualified individuals outside the state system—effectively making the process exclusionary.  To improve both efficiency and equity in hiring, California should implement a transparent, competency-based hiring framework. This would involve clearly defining the skills, knowledge, and outcomes expected for each classification and allowing candidates—whether internal or external—to demonstrate their qualifications through a combination of experience, education, and performance-based assessments. Such a model would reduce arbitrary equivalencies, promote fairness, and ensure that the most capable individuals are selected to serve the public, regardless of their entry point into government.",

      "content": "Recruitment and retention of state peace officers is harder than ever over the last 10 years.  Many police agencies have adjusted to the times and now allow officers to wear well groomed beards and display tattoos that are of good taste and not objectively offensive.  However, the California Highway Patrol has not allowed tattoos to be displayed nor male officers to have beards, all for the sake of tradition.  Our modern culture has grown to accept both as acceptable in the workplace, and in fact, makes officers more relatable.  Many communities may be able to relate to an officer who has tattoos, especially younger people.  As the melting pot of the United States, many foreign cultures co-exist in California and universally respect male officers with beards as being elders with serious life, and job experience, particularly when they see gray in the beard.  This makes them more willing to listen and being compliant with an officer.  It's already permitted for religious exemptions, i.e. for Sikh officers.  It should be permitted across the board for all officers.  This may seem like a non-issue to someone not in law enforcement, but other agencies have noticed higher levels of recruiting and retention by allowing tattoos and beards.  It is also a huge morale booster and allows officers to express themselves as individuals and humans, rather than as de-humanized, monotonous, faceless agents of the government.  I would like to see State Personnel Board force this issue with CHP",

      "content": "The state would save SO much money if it would revisit the mandatory new supervisor 80 hour training, 40 hour mandatory CEA training, and 40 hour mandatory manager training.  These used to be in-person classes where departments would pay CalHR approximately $1500 and staff would have an opportunity to collaborate with colleagues from other departments, get training, have an opportunity to ask questions and share ideas, etc. During COVID these classes went virtual and of the approximately 30 staff who have taken these courses since who I have personally discussed this with, they receive no value from the virtual trainings.  They are go-at-your-own pace, there is no engagement with others, and staff just have them running in the background to \"knock them out\" while they get their work done; yet departments still pay CalHR $1500 per employee.  Is there really a $1500 cost to CalHR when it's a virtual course with no instructor, no meeting room rental, no CalHR staff time, etc?  I understand this funds CalHR, but for industry-funded departments and programs who have to pay this cost, are they really getting any value for their dollar?  If CalHR would like to keep these courses automated and with no CalHR involvement the cost should be drastically reduced.  Or, to get more bang for their buck, it would be a much better investment if these courses went back to in-person.  Or at least allow departments that option.",

This last legislative cycle, I spent weeks commenting on a number of bills that came out from the same handful of lawmakers who had good intentions, but didn't understand the real challenges, concerns, or road blocks and didn't know what was already happening on a State level. All of that time could have been avoided if I was allowed to have sit-down meetings with the lawmakers who drafted or sponsored the bills rather than having to go through our legislative affairs who are not technical staff and do not fully understand our programs. This barrier causes laws to be passed that are not helping Californians, but are actually hindering them. It also results in significant governmental waste because it causes duplicative or conflicting efforts.",

Covid put restrictions on in person training. Yes, def. bring back in person training. Not all jobs can be learned virtually, at least not the ones I did.   As an employee, lack of mgmt guidance on growth, learning and promotions. They make you fill the IDP beginning of the year, and then what? It's not revisited till your next annual. Fancy document serves zero purpose.  Even as a manager, no support or encouragement for growth.  As a manager, you get to see abuse of time by staff clearly. Lack of mgmt support in documenting those staff for performance issues (lack of knowledge, ability, or simply abuse). The employees being written up have more rights than the manager who is documenting them for years, and years. So much time and resource wasted on documenting. Staff files complain against managers, and upper mgmt does nothing to support the manager. Then why would any manager want to waste their time and document ppl? the managers ruin their reputation by incompetent staff filing complains, and sadly upper mgmt. documents that on their annual, making it hard to promote for the manager, who is simply doing their job.  And so, no managers want to document and waste time.  Can't fire incompetent staff from state is the one benefits highly abused by ALOT of staff.  Huge waste of taxpayer's money, and state resources there.",

If a ban on gifts was enacted, the free meals and gifts would mostly cease, and we would see fewer staff recommendations (and fewer board approvals) to send billions into costly investments that are proven to underperform low-cost index funds.

I have to manually look up information, which is extremely time consuming and even what I am able to pull, can't tell me the information I need. I have to manually track what I can.   And speaking of excel, previously my team would print out lists provided from HQ to do projects. Again these lists are not in an excel format, which makes it difficult to weed out other district office information and focus on my district. So manually, I have to find out what applys to my office.   In the areas that I can, I have since shifted some of our projects to a shared drive, excel format and we color code what stage of the project my team is working on. When it is ready for my review, I can clearly see which ones need my attention and I can keep tabs in real time with where they are at.   Using more digital tools could makes us incredibly efficient and be able to focus more on items like customer service. When we have good tools, we can focus on what matters.",

This creates delays, duplicate work, and access issues — especially when PDFs are hard to use on mobile devices or when handwritten forms are difficult to read.  Instead of routing documents for signatures, we can use interactive online forms to collect structured data and automate approvals. Online forms are faster to set up, reusable, and mobile-friendly. They also ensure accuracy by requiring fields, validating entries, and feeding submissions directly into tabular formats like Excel or SharePoint Lists. This eliminates manual transcription, reduces errors, and cuts down on repetitive administrative work.  The benefits are clear:  - Saves time by reducing steps (no printing, scanning, or configuring signatures)  - Improves efficiency with real-time submission tracking and notifications  - Avoids waste by reducing paper use and redundant tasks  - Supports accessibility by providing legible, mobile-friendly entry options for both office and field staff  This small change could save staff and the general public hours each week and provide cleaner, more usable data for decision-making — aligning with Executive Order N-30-25’s call for operational efficiencies across state government.",

At one department, training compliance was at just 35%. I created a clear tracking system, sent regular reminders, and worked directly with staff to remove barriers to completion. Within months, compliance rose to 82%. In another role, customer service request closeouts were stuck in the 30–40% range. I streamlined the intake process, clarified responsibilities, and helped implement better follow-up procedures, which brought closeout rates to over 60%. These efforts not only improved efficiency but also boosted staff accountability and customer satisfaction. I take pride in identifying gaps and turning them into opportunities for improvement.",

When decisions around the workday are made at the top as blanket mandates, it heavily affects team morale and ultimately impacts hiring and retention. These decisions tie the hands of the supervisors that know the needs of their team best.   When turnover is high and hiring is slow, it impacts the entire team and service to taxpayers is slowed down heavily.   As the largest economy in the country and the State with the strongest worker protections, we should be leading the way in showing the rest of the country that people should always come first and that workers that are passionate, dedicated, and productive don’t always fit into boxes built at the top, nor should they have to.   The solution I propose would be to allow supervisors and teams that have proven track records to have more leeway in decisions around the workday. This would improve morale, increase talent available for hiring, increase retention, and put the focus on results for taxpayers over arbitrary outdated ideas around work.",

We're unable to properly manage our forests to prevent fires from being as destructive. We've even prevented police from enforcing current laws to keep people safe and we're seeing a surge in crime and violence.  2 - We need a stable power grid. We retired our nuclear plants even though they're the safest and cleanest source of stable power which our grid desperately needs - especially if we want to move towards all electric cars. Solar is great on existing infrastructure, but we've been clear cutting the forests to build those instead which destroys our beautiful countryside and it only generates power when the sun is shining. We should be developing fusion and building out a grid to support our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and cleaning up our air. We need trees and plants in the cities to help clean the air there and reduce the impact of brake dust and other particulates in the air. We can't claim to be wanting green energy while simultaneously clear cutting forests and countryside for something that results in brown outs and black outs because it's not stable enough to meet the core energy demands of the people.",

As someone that was new to an organization during telework, I felt that I was never really a \"part\" of the organization. There are people that I've only seen on Teams. The relationships that they have with others that they knew \"pre-pandemic\" had a place to start. So they have no issue with IMs/etc to communicate. But when there is no opportunity to actually get to know people in the workplace, the team dynamic suffers. I'm happy with a mixed model telework program of 3 days in office.",

If your labor force is non-committal, then maybe it is time for a trust building exercise...these ideas are regularly explored in books regarding leadership. Read \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" or Carly Fiorina's \"Tough Choices\". In this moment, millennials and younger generations have a lot to teach. They were born into the world of data.

Almost all the business owners we meet do not use a computer or own one and therefore, rely on their cellphones conduct day-to-day business activities like accepting a payment through Zelle for the sale of a t-shirt or food, business banking, creating a sales invoice to give to a customer, using Square to swipe a credit card payment, etc. Specifically, I would like to see that a user-friendly cellphone app is developed for CDTFA to make it easy for a business owner to register for a seller’s permit, make changes to the account (like an address changes or adding/closing business locations), pay sales taxes/state revenues, eFile tax returns for up to two locations, show past due taxes owed, setting up payment plans, and making a request for tax relief from penalty, interest, etc. I specifically would like this app to cross-register the business owner for other licenses and fee accounts under the authority of CDTFA.   The interface of this app should be easily uploaded to CDTFA's database in real time or within 24-hours. Add a chat function using AI to answer basic questions.",

I would suggest singular core documents focusing on the projects and their exceptions with varied signature pages depending on the level of delegation.

      "content": "I have been a buyer, contract analyst and purchasing manager for some years. I think some of the excessive purchasing laws and policies make the State purchasing/contracting procedure unnecessarily complex. Simplifying the process and reducing the number of forms needed not only expedites the process but also saves taxpayer money. One example I suggest removing is the DVBE participation requirement in formal solicitations. Almost, 99% of the times, it's been waived due to highly specialised services or other factors. These types of laws and policies do not help DVBEs; they just add additional paperwork and delay the contracting process. Other examples are forms like Darfur, California Civil  Rights Laws Attachment, and Iran Contracting Act Verification that need to be submitted by bidders/contractors, or 113 pages of Telecom General Provisions included in telecom contracts. The lengthy provisions and forms that are never looked at or used for anything waste taxpayer money and complicate the process for companies. Some vendors, especially Small Business suppliers they do not have a lawyer on board to help them understand the State contract provisions and for that reason do not participate in bidding opportunities. There are a lot of requirements during the purchasing process that could be removed or simplified. I'm referring to the laws and policies included in State Contracting Manuals Volumes I & II and State Administrative Manual (SAM).",

We can and must do better for our youth and for the many adults who never had a real chance to earn a diploma. In California, certain vulnerable student populations—such as those who have experienced homelessness, incarceration, or time in the foster care system—can graduate with a reduced requirement of 130 credits under AB 216. I propose that this same credit pathway be offered to adults, age 18 and older, who enroll in accredited adult school programs. Many adults who dropped out of high school faced serious obstacles: poverty, family instability, violence in their communities, or disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Without a diploma, these individuals are often stuck in low-wage jobs with little opportunity for advancement. A HS diploma opens doors to job training programs, community college, military service, and promotions.  •\tThe state gains from increased tax revenue as graduates earn higher wages. •\tAdult schools benefit from federal funding tied to improved student outcomes. •\tEmployers gain access to a more skilled and motivated workforce. •\tBusinesses benefit from the increased purchasing power of newly employed adults. •\tCommunities see reduced crime rates and greater social stability. Expand the 130-credit diploma option to adults. Its a low cost, high impact solution.",

I spend countless taxpayer-funded hours navigating statewide contracts and multi-tiered purchasing requirements, all with minimal administrative support. I have to ask proprietors of small businesses to submit mountains of forms, including one that confirms they never supported a 20 year old international atrocity, and then I have ask them to float their own overhead costs before I can pay them for their services.

These improvements not only save time for employees but also make it easier for Californians to access the resources they need. Implementing these changes hasn’t always been easy. At times, I struggled to get buy-in from my direct supervisor and had to elevate ideas above her to leadership in order to move them forward.

Additionally, this is supposed to be a deliberative democracy forum, as such reasoned positions are valid and should not be limited. Overall, as a state employee that is in a hybrid position working both in person and virtually at times, it is important to validate the values that virtual work affords state employees, state agencies, people in our state, and the state budget. It is also important to see how virtual work solves for problems in inefficiency and ineffectiveness, and can help to solve for ways to better serve the people in our state.   A primary problem right now is the position that virtual work shouldn't be part of the Engaged California discussion to find solutions to problems (because it is supposedly doesn't \"stay on topic\" - see Engaged California's \"Sharing Guidelines\" ).  It makes no sense to talk about workplace efficiency and effectiveness, and to talk about better ways to serve the people in our state without considering talent management, workplaces, work mediums/channels, and work spaces.

Workplace morale and trust suffer when people perceive that opportunities aren't fairly earned. Erosion of public trust (especially in public or regulatory roles) when the public suspects favoritism in staffing.  We should advocate for more transparent recruitment and selection processes. Push for independent hiring panels, blind application reviews, or standardized interviews. Encourage whistleblower protections for those who report unfair practices.  Circumvention of Minimum Qualifications (MQs)  Some candidates may be circumventing qualifications by enrolling in quick, sometimes low-rigor or unaccredited online graduate programs, just to “check the box.”  This undermines the intent of MQs, which are supposed to ensure a candidate has a certain level of baseline expertise.  It can devalue the profession and create inequities against those who pursued more rigorous paths.  We should push for HR and classification teams to clarify standards: not just “enrollment” but substantial progress or completion from accredited institutions. Consider evaluating equivalencies in a more meaningful way — e.g., experience + coursework, or requiring specific coursework from recognized programs.  Advocate for quality assurance checks on accepted degrees — ensuring they come from regionally accredited institutions, not diploma mills or for-profit degree factories.",

      "content": "The primary problem with working for the State of California is the way staff are treated. Most supervisors receive thorough training on how to issue disciplinary actions, but very little, if any, on how to actually lead, motivate, and support their teams. This results in a culture of enforcement over empowerment, where employees often feel undervalued and micromanaged rather than inspired to perform at their best.  Suggested solutions:   Implement hiring and promotion practices that prioritize: People skills, Proven ability to develop others, and Desire to lead not just manage. Select supervisors based on leadership potential. The work can be learned on the job but emotional intelligence needs to be there before they become a supervisor and have power over peoples careers.  Build accountability for “how” supervisors lead. Tie supervisor performance evaluations and promotions to: Team morale and retention metrics (if there is a high turn-over then something is wrong that shouldn't be ignored), 360-degree feedback from staff (this is one I have implemented upon myself), and Demonstrated leadership behaviors — not just output numbers.  Shift the culture from punitive to supportive. Encourage a workplace philosophy that emphasizes: Employee engagement over enforcement Problem-solving conversations instead of automatic discipline, Psychological safety, where staff feel comfortable speaking up.  Invest in real leadership development not just a book club.",

For example, if HR representatives are dismissive or rude, employees should have a safe and professional channel to raise these concerns. Employees have the right to follow up on matters that directly affect them, and there should be accountability when those rights are not respected. 3.\tTransparency in Hiring Practices I have observed instances where Directors or Deputy Directors appear to hire individuals they have previously worked with. While it is sometimes stated that leadership was not involved in the hiring process, those same individuals are still selected for high-level positions.

Here's my contribution after working for the State of California on and off for 15+ years.  State salaries Certain State positions are pigeonhole into arbitrary (or based on outdated data) salary ranges without taking account location and parity with the private sector.  For example, the HFEN (Health Facility Evaluator Nurse) position. A comparable position in the private sector, in the San Francisco area, (according to Google) is around $155K (for a nurse consultant).  My compensation for 2023 according to Transparent California =$98,271.44 (not counting benefits as the average salary quoted by Google does not include benefits)  I've been with the State long enough to know that trying to ask for fair compensation is like trying to get blood from stone.  I get it. We are painted with the same brush. We are stigmatized as being lazy, inefficient, bureaucratic etc. What tax payers would reward State workers with a pay raise? (slim to none)  So here is my proposal. Don't reward my efficiency with more work and flowery praise. Compensate me financially. There's an Over Time budget within each department. Give me access to the OT budget, I don't mind writing a proposal on how I can increase your/my Department's efficiency or backlogs to solve your problems. I'm ready to kick start this in my Department ...Are any Managers ready?",

In my role, I engage with community based organizations, researchers, and local government all across the state. I would not be able to do that without teleconferencing tools and support for telework—even if we had the funds to support travel, I can't be in multiple places at once, and it is more effective to have everyone in conversation together. The State government of California does not only serve Sacramento, yet without telework I am less effectively able to serve communities outside of the Sacramento area. Telework saves money, reduces pollution and traffic, and makes state workers more efficient. I am able to do more work in the same amount of time if I don't have to run around a poorly planned building to find a bathroom or navigate a lengthy commute. When working at headquarters, my colleagues frequently have to interrupt meetings in order to move their cars because we don't have the infrastructure to actually support employees working in the office, even on a 2 day/week in office schedule. Additionally, I am less likely while working remotely to experience microaggressions and other behavior from coworkers that could lead to a lawsuit against the state.",

I joined the state in November 2020, and have held excluded and represented positions at three different departments within the same field since then.

I cannot speak for others, and many roles are critically accomplished through in-person attendance. However, a blanket return to office mandate is out of touch with the ground reality of the public employees who keep the state running.  A blanket RTO mandate also puts undue pressure on departments and individuals to justify exceptions, particularly when it comes to Reasonable Accommodations; especially those RA's addressing invisible disability. Although I am aware (as an EEO investigator) that bad actors try to manipulate these civil protections, folks who have engaged in good faith interactions with their employers for many years are extremely anxious. Although their limitations have not changed, the expectations surrounding their employment will if RTO moves forward in 2026 (which, despite protective statute, is common via employer-friendly interpretations of RA law and policy).  To me, the solution is obvious: reject blanket RTO so departments can TRULY treat each person & job uniquely. In addition to cost saving, the state will retain employees enthusiastic about their jobs and committed to careers that don't pay like the private sector.",

P2) Management do not seek the opinions of rank-and-file staff when proposing changes, limiting the potential for innovative ideas S2) Implement systems like Engaged California on a department level. P3) State exams that test experience, education, and training do not accurately test whether a candidate is fit for a position S3) Phase out this type of exam, as it only provides unnecessary hurdles to qualified candidates, and give more discretion to departments to hire candidates.

Processes like contracting have extremely specific protocols and therefore very specific training. Whenever we lose an employee, that gap can take over a year to fill and the next person might take over a months to over a year to get up to speed. This issue also dovetails into the issue of severe under staffing. Some units are operating at well under 50% of the necessary staff, or even more. When appropriately staffed units need to interface with those who have poor staffing, that causes bottlenecks which lead to months of delay. There just are not enough people to do the jobs necessary to keep the fundamental processes of our bureaucracy moving smoothly. If we can improve retention and staffing, it will go a long way to accelerating timelines and improving efficiency.",

Use AI document translation with a common lexicon, have a disclaimer and feedback mechanism to prioritize review (e.g. vital docs), ID bad translations, recommend improvements. Also flag items past a certain revise date. At present we have active standard forms owned by agencies that no longer exist and historic documents posted that pop up when searching for current policy. It is not always clear what is current and what is outdated. Systems like WorldCat and GoogleBooks provide models, and there could also be a concierge function for the public to punch in what they need and receive instructions along with any necessary forms and guidelines (perhaps compiled by AI and verified by human staff, moving to spot checks as effectiveness of the tech is demonstrated).",

The only way to be promoted is to find an open position req in a different department. I understand that we want to be good stewards of public funds, that we want to avoid even the appearance of nepotism or corruption, and that we don't want to promote without need. And there have been very public instances of nepotism and corruption in hiring and promotions. But the current system forces people who want a long-term career in public service to leave their departments to move up, taking all their \"tribal knowledge\" with them. It forces departments to cannibalize each another. The system does not consider the value of the months, or years, it takes to train the next person who eventually fills that loss. That value must be given more weight. And if a department is full of long-term people punching above their weight, there should be some sort of extenuating circumstances to make a PIP easier. It's worth it to promote people for their knowledge and ability once in a while, to encourage more people to consider long-term public sector careers.",

I pretty much knew that going in, but when I actually experienced it I was kind of shocked. Everything is just so difficult! I'm used to having ownership of my role and various tasks and getting things handled quickly - not having to go through 15 people for something or having to wait 8 months for a PO and then supervisor approval and to only order something from one specific place, for example. Also, I get a lot of emails and phone calls from the public and it can be incredibly difficult trying to determine who to forward to. I often go to our website and sit there scrolling through trying to find the info myself, with much difficulty.   Oh and the way people make payments online - the entire system needs to be overhauled. All of the phone calls I receive are either about duplicate payments on their credit card, or they couldn't log in to their account to make their payment. I then have to take down all their info and email my contacts to ask them to help. Takes a lot of time!

I would like to see more rent control so that folks aren't paying more than half of their income to private equity firms & corrupt landlords.

If the state wants to begin to hire a new generation of employees, the authoritarian style of management needs to change. Younger generations will not want to be treated the way most state employees are being treated now.

      "content": "First, a few problems affecting individuals with disabilities: 1. Currently, the ADA and other state laws do not apply to rental housing (especially single-family homes) as well as new homes. Because of this an individual with a disability cannot get a home that has a ramp, walk-in shower, light-based fire alarm, or tactile controls. Many of these adaptations are available by default when accessing public facilities and commercial organizations open to the public. Yet, in the context of housing people with disabilities have to spend tens of thousands to make these conversions. There are exceptions for affordable housing, not all people are eligible for these opportunities. The State should make an effort to make sure accessibility is improved, so that homes are available that meet these requirements and the option to make these changes in new homes by lowering barriers. 2. Many states including Washington, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Massachusetts have Medicaid working disabled programs that operate without income or asset limits. This assists individuals with disabilities would like to work but cannot because insurance does not cover services like long-term care. To ensure that these programs remain financially viable the states have imposed premiums of at least 7% of a person's income. California should consider similar programs.  Second, the State should encourage remote work for employees. It improves retention, mental health and employee well-being.",

The application and reverification process that the Housing Choice Voucher program created online is incredibly effective and simple to use. It would be great to see all customer facing departments use a simple, online system that removes barriers and hurdles between the public and their benefits.",

My ideas for solving the problem I shared includes creating expectations for higher communication standards, such as through departmental policies or other methods, to encourage faster processing times and responses to email and other typical communications methods.",

UI is insurance to be leveraged while in between job opportunities and it needs emphasizing that UI works best for those who work, whether it be temporary, contract and seasonal work until they have obtained permanent work, thereby a new claim may be valid at the BYE so long as there was work lost at no fault of the employee in the most recent 12 months.  The public needs to be aware that they are tapping into the tax reserves of the employers when leveraging these UI benefits and that they should not be abusing the opportunity to benefit from these resources as a matter of sustaining our economic structure. Abuse begets further abuse.  Furthermore, there is a need for workforce localities to reinvest in establishing a new system for hiring that does not involve digital platforms that no longer vet job listing.  Local job listing need to be verified and documented as current, valid and verifiable and then removed upon fulfillment. Human resource systems needs governance and accountability and turning over a system that is respectful of the authority of our local workforce departments could be a viable option for building viable businesses in our communities. This is how it used it used to.",

      "content": "The state needs to stop spending money on sending new hires to train at facilities that are far from their home office, especially for lower income classifications like the Office Assistant and Office Technician. Although these travel trips for trainings are exciting and refreshing, the return on investment is not enough to justify training trips. In most circumstances, lower paying classifications would benefit more from having a higher salary rather than going on a state sponsored training trip. Office Assistants and Office Technicians are more likely to quit or leave for higher paying jobs because these classifications do not make livable wages. California is expensive to live independently and there is more value in paying these classifications more, and less value in paying for travel and training expenses when employees in these classifications are highly likely to change jobs for something that pays more. The citizens of California would benefit more from having higher paying entry-level jobs in these classifications. Most people don't care about going on a state sponsored training trip when they are going to come back to a mediocre salary. They'll just leave for a higher paying job, thus resulting in funding and resources being wasted on that employee.",

      "content": "A primary way to become more effective and efficient is to meaningfully invest in recruitment and retention. Like many here, I've worked at different departments over several years and it’s become incredibly challenging to recruit and retain talented professionals. Telework and statewide hiring in the early 2020s helped us recruit skilled professionals from across the state. But now, with pay falling behind the private sector, few opportunities for advancement, and new in-office requirements, we lost dedicated employees who have years of experience and institutional knowledge, and try to replace them (if we can), which is expensive and slow.   One of the biggest reasons people choose state service is PSLF. Recent proposed federal changes that raise monthly repayments upwards of 500% and will likely disqualify employees from certain states have taken that recruitment/retention tool away.   I believe CA should create its own Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) for state employees. We already have successful models with the CA Legislature authorizing an LRAP through CalATJ for legal aid attorneys, and CalHealthCares using Prop. 56 funds to offer up to $300,000 in loan repayment for physicians who commit to five years of service. Building on those for a broader program that is for all state employees would be a powerful tool to recruit and retain talented professionals, keep expertise in-house, and strengthen the quality and stability of public service across the state.",

When I’ve tried to set boundaries or decline unpaid work, it has at times resulted in retaliation or a sense of “quid pro quo,” where cooperation is exchanged for fair treatment.  A potential solution could be to ensure that duty statements clearly define expectations around on-call work and overtime. Additionally, management should receive better training on employee classifications, what constitutes on-call/duty officer status, and how compensation for these duties should be handled.",

      "content": "As a newer state employee, I believe we waste too much time updating content on our internal and external websites. Every hour wasted has to be funded from the taxes of hard-working Californians, and so we should try to reduce that waste.   I believe the latest State Web Template is a great solution to get all of our sites using a similar codebase. However, our department is having to update HTML code by-hand, using nearly obsolete software.  I propose using a open-soure framework like Laravel, which runs on PHP. It would allow us to easily port the State Web Template components into reusable componenents that could be placed on web pages without having to painstakingly copy code. We also could probably provide much of the content in Markdown format, which could be converted to accessible HTML on the fly. Laravel also has some database-driven content management system options such as Statamic.  The end result is that we could save time and money for Californian, while also providing more consistent and timely content.",

Through several years in my department, I have observed management routinely fails to communicate down to the supervisors or rank and file. Additionally, I have observed management almost never looks down for answers to problems. I believe this is due to a consistent belief that only managers are stakeholders on departmental issues.  In my role as a second-line supervisor I have made it a point to know what is changing and keep updated on regulatory changes. When something does change, I make it a point to communicate the change to my staff and allow my staff to provide input on how that change is implemented.   I found through my career, CDCR management consistently fails to identify the stakeholders when programs change or get implemented. I try to overcome this failure by allowing my staff to feel as if their expertise and opinion have value. Though one-on-one and group conversations with my staff I ask how they would make it better, or how they could have handled issues differently in the future. Unfortunately, I cannot share this information with management as either they would demand staff to be \"written up\" for a minor mistake or explain management makes all the decisions.",

I timed how long it take to open a Attachments or a plan and it takes 32 seconds, and I open almost 50 documents a day in AWARE. I did the math and that equals 26 minutes  of waiting at the end of the day. That is precious time that I could have met with a participant, but instead I'm waiting for an attachment to open.   Also, each time they update aware it messes up almost everything, every time. In the last update it make it so I couldn't see SSN or any valuable information and it took weeks to figure it out.   secondly, I think \"Activity Dues\" (AD) are an awful way to delegate tasks. When changes are made or notes were left on the AD we don't get told at all. We have to remember to go back and check, and with a caseload of 200, that is almost impossible.   Lastly, The state need to live in reality and realize that people don't want to work/stay at the DOR is because our pay absolutely absurd!! For the amount of work we do, and the amount of situations this job put us in, we are treated and paid like our work doesn't matter. People at the DOR feel like the state of California doesn't care about their civil servants who dedicate their life's to helping the lives of people with disabilities.

If a department has a repair or modification that needs to be done, it must go through DGS and they will do the work themselves, contract out, or very rarely delegate the project back to departments. DGS charges an absurd amount for their overhead and project management costs, and takes several years to complete projects.  For example, our department needed a new HVAC unit that took DGS 4 years to complete and a new roof that took 5.  A private contractor can do this work for pennies on the dollar and in days vs years, saving the state millions.  Why can't DGS delegate some of this work to departments?  They say the government code requires them to do everything, but how long do we need to keep referring to these code sections without considering amendments to streamline government?  My department has had to lay off seasonal staff because DGS' costs kept going up and we couldn't afford to pay for a repair that was taking 3 years and also continue our operations.  And if DGS has vacancies, the work just sits there and doesn't get done until they hire and train more staff.  This is an INCREDIBLE waste of state resources.  Also, take a look at Unit 9's salaries.  The amount it costs to pay DGS for this work is WAY above what the state could be paying a private contractor, even at a prevailing wage.  Please streamline this process and allow/require DGS to delegate more facility projects to the departments!",

Rather than go out and have contractors propose solutions without fully understanding the ever-evolving business needs, the state should develop a \"proof of concept\" in house prior to going to RFP. This means developing enough of the tool to see system limitations and get an idea on its overall functionality. This would help develop requirements of the tool as we see shortcomings of what is developed but could also be used as a way to help contractors understand what is being sought out. I would suggest involving program (the internal state teams that would use the tool) early on to ensure the business rules are represented. At the discretion of the State, then we could move to a formal RFP and demo the proof of concept or we could continue development in house.  I will avoid referencing specific projects, but I can confirm that this approach would have ruled out proposals that relied heavily on tools that did not meet the need while saving a considerable amount of money.",

Even worse is when low level (say AGPA) is trying to do the best job they can, but don't realize the negative impact they are creating or the laws that they are breaking.  For example, a AGPA needs data from another agency.  They are blanketly ask for the information.  The other agency, doing the best job they can do, says Ok and collects the data. However, collecting that information could have taken 80 hours, or require a \"system\" to be built to accommodate the request.  When looking deeper into \"the information\", it was never required by law to collect the data. This is unnecessary waste.  Times this by 1000's of request, and we're all working for each other, and not the people of CA.  State employees are very hard workers and try their best.  Sometimes, we need to step back and make sure we are doing what we should be doing, and not what we want to do.  This wasteful work leads to wasted time spent, delays in the work that should be done, and selfish pride.  Laws - we all have to abide by them.  However, many laws have \"sunset dates\".  it would be nice if the State of CA did a cross analysis of what policy was created for what law.  if that law was changed, modified, or unsetted, then the policy needs to do the same.  Laws aren't typically created from scratch; they take an existing law and totally rewrite it.",

Real-Time Data Matching with Other Agencies • Build secure connections with agencies like FTB, EDD and IRS. • Use automated cross-checking to flag discrepancies before audits or deadlines. • This reduces underreporting, improves fairness, and minimizes manual comparison.  2. Mobile App for Taxpayers • Provide an easy-to-use app for filing, payments, and notifications. • Improves compliance by making tax obligations clearer and more convenient. • Reduces taxpayer confusion and the volume of support inquiries.  3. Training on New Technologies • Invest in upskilling employees in AI, data analytics, and customer service. • Prepares the workforce to handle modern tools efficiently. • Ensures smooth adoption of new systems and better service for taxpayers.",

Outdated software programs that create more manual processes needed to accomplish tasks.  Allocation of funding towards deferred maintenance of equipment and buildings. Everything turns into an emergency once it's broken because no consideration is given for deferred maintenance. Government is always reactive vs proactive, and this costs time and prevents employees from getting their jobs done when equipment breaks down and the bureaucracy involved to get it repaired.  Lack of resources or resources that don't fulfill their obligations or doesn't respond to emails or communications (Departments that have oversight not responding to communications in a timely manner or at all in some cases).  Better HR processes to allow new staff to be trained before exiting staff leave. The state has zero regard for this, and each new employee is left to fend for themselves and try to figure out what the person they replaced was doing. This causes a ripple effect with everyone this person works with and creates more work for all involved.  Departments not meeting their own requirements and posted completion promises. For example, a department quotes a 10-business day review time, but reality is 30-45+ days is the normal.",

Too often, employees face challenges such as outdated classifications, pay that does not reflect the cost of living, and limited flexibility in how we work.  To solve this, I would advocate for three key improvements: first, expanding telework options where appropriate, since telework has proven to increase productivity, save costs, and improve work–life balance; second, raising pay scales to be more competitive so that we can attract and keep skilled workers; and third, ensuring proper classifications so employees are recognized and compensated for the full scope of their responsibilities.  By addressing these issues, we would not only strengthen morale and retention among state workers but also improve the quality of service delivered to Californians.",

Soft-on-crime policies created safe havens for criminals, while homelessness is out of control despite billions spent. The state throws money at symptoms without addressing root causes like addiction and mental illness, and restrictive zoning makes affordable housing impossible. California isn’t broke, it’s just It’s failing because its leaders prioritize woke virtue signaling, radical environmentalism, and identity politics over law, order, affordability, and common sense. Unfortunately, I don’t think that’s going to change under a one-party rule.",

We transitioned to a paperless file system  back in 2006 when the State began requiring reports/data to be submitted and uploaded to the Geotracker database. There are still 100s of existing folders, reports, etc. (one estimate was that our unit's file room contains 1/3 of a mile of paper). Environmental pollution cases are unique: we're required to keep records of all sites, closed or not, in case land use changes in the future (also, it's the law). We routinely have PRA/FOIA requests to pull files for consultant review, and more than 75% of the time they'll ask us to scan and email them.  Our region is also vast- some of these consultants and landowners live 6 hours away from out office, and some have physical handicaps that limit their mobility, so we try to oblige. But actually taking apart a file, scanning it, categorizing it, and uploading it is extremely labor intensive. A small file will take a few hours, but even a medium sized one requires one or two days (the scanning is rapid, uploading and naming is laborious).  SOLUTIONS: 1) hire dedicated admin staff to do this work, 2) subcontract it out to a bonded document scanning service. BENEFITS: 1) Reduced labor costs for professional and admin staff 2) improved public access for these records 3) potential to upload to AI for detailed summation and analysis. Thank you,",

I agree with the person below, the training, not the annual training we all get, but the hands-on training we get is poor.  I get the impression that the supervisor doesn't really know what the person in the position does.  Instead of help, it's criticism and sometimes yelling at a person.  I come from years of private sector work and the environment between state and private is so different. I'd like to see more cooperation and less dictatorship and egotism.  We all have a job to do, and we do it better when we cooperate instead of arguing or putting each other down.  I'd like to see consistency from one area to another within the Dept.  There was an attempt to make all institutions the same and that is a great idea, but it didn't really happen like it was intended to.  I still see a lot of confusion and inconsistency which makes it difficult to get things done.

Fully remote positions opened the door for me, and I am sure many others who want to contribute but are limited by their location in California.

All people hear about are the slow wheels of bureaucracy and government waste, not realizing that the design is purposeful. Obviously there ways to make things more efficient, like digitizing forms, modernizing ways to make payments, etc. However, my experience is that most agencies are working on these issues. Just look at the DMV, or being able to pay a parking ticket on your phone, amazing! However, due to the nature of our work, sometimes it's important to work slowly and methodically, with standard procedures. When we \"move fast and break things\" or suffer from burnout trying to \"optimize\" our workday into hyper-efficiency, those things effect people's lives very deeply and if we can be thoughtful, we can make them better than the original concept. When we do that, it always pays us back, fiscally as well as socially. Because the public is so focused on waste, instead of hiring internally, we hire contractors, and instead of hiring the best contractor, we have to hire the one with the lowest bid. This creates real waste that hurts the tax payers and frustration of employees. There's a reason why most private tech companies crash, and that's no way to run a government.",

I could find what I wanted, but I would have had to go to two different stores, in two different towns to get them.  Why they wouldn't ship them since it was the same store is an enigma to me, but they wouldn't.  When I contacted city transportation, I didn't have my own vehicle at that time, it would take me two days to get two pair of shoes because of the amount of time it took to get to just one store from where I lived and I couldn't get to that store in two different towns on the same day.  Needless to say, I didn't get any shoes.  It baffles me that one cannot take a bus to a shopping mall.  It baffles me that public transit doesn't run more often, it baffles me that there are not at least certain consistent schedules to go to public places that everyone needs to go to, like malls, medical facilities, grocery stores, libraries, DMV, Social Security; these places have set hours so why can't public transportation run consistently with them?  Why can a person only go to one place in a day?  With public shootings and violence, I'm not sure I'd want to be on public transit anyway.  I try to avoid public places to start with even though I can drive there.",

There's zero continuity in the clinics, so that plan is fraught with issue after issue. Custody has become too complacent in regard to safety and security. A resident in C Yard was caught with eleven diabetic syringes/needles. That particular resident gets insulin twice a day, so they were able to acquire all those needles over a period of time. Residents bring their tablet to the pill window and in the clinic. The tablets aren't allowed to leave the housing units for obvious reasons. A patient reported to an exam room to complete their appointment with me this week with a hot cup of coffee. I didn't notice he was holding it until we were in the room together. The porters/residents in our clinic are allowed to \"clean\" without anyone directly watching them. The porters/residents are given access to areas they should never be given entry to.",

Consolidating office space (combine multiple departments/agencies into spaces) will save money, as per the state auditor's report. State Workers working remotely will also save money by reduced commutes and the associated climate change savings, which used to be important to our state government, and by putting money back in their own communities, versus being expected to prop up the communities around the office buildings their departments are located in.  It also increases employee happiness, and as a long-term state worker who has been in offices with both great morale and awful morale (both prior to the availability of telework, and not related to telework at all) happy employees make for more productive employees.  Telework works, the state has shown that.  Reversing course will only hurt the state going forward.",

As a Civil Engineer myself, I have had to learn these skills on the job, with no vision ahead supporting the recruiting of the necessary talent needed. I served in PECG as a union rep and I learned it's up to Department of Technology to change their ways, not PECG.

      "content": "I believe the core issue lies in the lack of employee responsibility and accountability. Government bureaucracy is structured in a way that pushes decision-making upward through the chain of command, concentrating authority in the hands of a few. This results in an overabundance of policies and procedures that strip decision-making power from the subject matter experts—the individuals actually performing the hands-on work.  Furthermore, this system fosters a dense layer of middle management that often controls decisions without fully understanding their upstream or downstream impacts. This disconnect between decision-makers and practitioners undermines efficiency and responsiveness.  To truly improve government operations, this overarching management structure must be reformed. Such reform will likely require legislative action to decentralize authority, empower technical experts, and streamline bureaucratic processes.",

Therefore, rotating managers and supervisors between departments can provide advantages on both sides.

      "content": "I would address is the breakdown in communication, specifically how long it takes to report and resolve operational problems. In my experience, communication often functions as a buffer that insulates leadership from the daily realities faced by frontline staff. When issues arise, responses are frequently delayed due to layers of approval, bureaucratic hurdles, or vague assurances that “it’s being looked into.” This delay not only prolongs the problem but can exacerbate it to the point of creating liability or safety risks. Unfortunately, when these issues escalate, leadership may downplay their prior awareness, further eroding trust and morale.  To solve this, I would advocate for a transparent, time-bound communication protocol that includes:  •\tA tiered reporting system that tracks issues from initial submission to resolution, with clear accountability at each level.  While some systems are already in place the emphasis should be on ensuring managers cannot minimize their role when issues persist.  •\tMandatory feedback loops where leadership must acknowledge receipt and provide status updates within a set timeframe.  •\tConsistent process audits to identify bottlenecks and recurring delays, followed by actionable reforms.  •\tAnd most importantly, a culture shift that values timely action over bureaucratic deflection, recognizing that unresolved issues create stress, inefficiency, and risk for those doing the work.  This should be done while respecting existing labor rights.",

Centralizing coordination on streamlined/simplified IQP requirements would save a huge amount of work in terms of verification and avoiding having to replicate similar work across departments.   Here's the vision someone who is qualified for a subsidized electricity rate may also be qualified for CalFresh. However, the requirements are not aligned, which means that these two programs cannot automatically \"talk\" to each other. Ideally, it would be good to have a universal crosswalk of IQPs so that if you sign up for one, you are offered access to all of the others at the same time. This might look like a central hub for accessing all social/welfare benefits run by the state where you fill out an initial intake survey (limited to 15 questions *max*) and then have all programs you qualify for presented to you for sign up, in such a way that you can just check a box and batch-enroll in multiple at once.  Undoubtedly this would require some legislation to fully align, but doing the groundwork to understand all IQP requirements and set up the crosswalk is the first step. But that requires someone who can work across all departments that offer some kind of IQP.",

Addressing these issues helps to ensure a happy and healthy workforce which is key to good customer service, performance, and efficiency. Workers need to have their needs met in order to perform at their best. The state should strive to provide the best work environment possible to each of it's employees. This should not be a one-size-fits-all approach as every human has different needs. Some people need more support than others. Some require more guidance. Others need less. The state should also do more to understand neurodivergence within the workforce as it plays a part in the needs of each individual. This is also true for each role, not classification. Each role has different requirements of technology, tools, communication, supplies, etc. Tailoring things to the individual and the role they fill will greatly improve efficiency, productivity, collaboration, communication, quality of work, etc.",

I believe the State should evaluate positions assigned to agencies with inherently high-risk environments and implement reclassifications where appropriate, rather than requiring these changes to go through the bargaining process where they often become negotiation points. Employees in specialized or marginalized classifications—such as mine, which includes only 13 positions statewide—lack the collective representation needed to advocate effectively for these changes.

By broadening the definitions of success we can address phenomenon like corruption, toxicity, hoarding and emphasize values like sharing and improve empathy and caring generally. As we share intelligence and apply it to these common goals people experience and learn from the experience of others so problems that threaten societies are minimized as the cooperation crosses typical socio-economic and other common isolating conditions that threaten an optimal healthy form of democracy and threaten environmental sustainability.

      "content": "&gt;&gt;Problem: The Six-Month Probationary Period for AGPAs is Inadequate to Properly Train and Evaluate &gt;&gt;Solution: Extend AGPA Probationary Period to One Year ------------ I recommend we align the probationary period for Associate Governmental Program Analysts (AGPA) with that of Staff Services Analysts (SSA), Staff Services Manager I (SSM1), and most other state classifications. The current 6-month probationary period for AGPA's is insufficient for thorough training and evaluation, particularly for new hires without prior program knowledge and experience. This short period forces managers to make premature decisions about an employee's capabilities, potentially leading to the rejection of individuals who could excel with more time. By increasing the probationary period to one-year, new AGPAs will have adequate time to become proficient in their roles, ensuring fair evaluation and comprehensive training. This change will also expand the hiring pool, allowing managers to confidently consider AGPA candidates, knowing they will have sufficient time to develop necessary skills. The 6-month probationary period should be retained for AGPAs promoted in place, as they already possess relevant experience from their SSA roles in the same program. Extending the AGPA probationary period to one year for new hires would be a win-win for staff and managers.",

Most times the work is shifted to individuals who are actually doing the work and there is no real disciplinary action for those who don't. This attitude not only undermines productivity but also fosters a frustrating environment for individuals who are committed to their work. This disconnect can result in lack of motivation among employees who strive to uphold high standards. I believe we can do better in promoting accountability and recognizing the contributions of those who genuinely contribute to the team's success in order to have a more positive work environment. Employees should, in my opinion, have more ways to voice their opinions without fear of retalition, and they should be fairly offered opportunites for advancement based on their performance.

This saps motivation and can lead to a public service workforce that's just \"going through the motions\" to get the paycheck / no longer spurred by desire to serve the public. - Hierarchical org structure that minimizes the ideas and opinions of rank-and-file employees. - There are few \"senior staff,\" non-management positions. This results in many people being promoted to manager roles that they're either unprepared or not suited for.  Solutions:  - Opportunities for people at all levels to participate in developing organizational vision and goals.  - Foster a culture where staff are encouraged to share ideas even if/when they're contradictory to \"direction\" from above. - Creation of more senior staff positions where people can move up in agencies without becoming managers.",

If student is a graduate, I fill out another form to request their removal from education, DocuSign it to my supervisor, and the supervisor then requests the drop from the institution's assignments officer.  Attendance works similarly. Within 15 minutes of class starting, I fill out a form showing absent students and email it to our education officer. Education officer spends his time calling each IPs housing officer, if they can be reached, to verify if IP is coming to school or not, then the education officer notes \"A\" time, \"S\" time, etc ... and returns to me to fill out SOMS attendance.

Since, in the United States, we are considered a \"donor state\" in reference to our relationship with the federal government, anytime California projects a deficit, we should just reduce our \"donation\" to the federal government to keep it balanced at the very least, and create a buffer of revenue as a means to be fiscally disciplined. Secondly, we need to take large corporations to task for boasting California as their home, but slighting the State when it comes to taxes and being disciplined environmental stewards. As an example, the oil and utility companies are running rough shod over the State and poisoning our lands and waters. Ultimately, this recouped revenue would go along way to make State worker pay, not only competitive, but superior to the private sector.

Billions are being diverted for other programs yet State Workers get their pay threatened constantly by going over budget.

This excess of high-level specialist jobs take responsibilities away from the supervisors and management staff, while putting more pressure on the entry level staff to do more with less (leading to more errors and more labor hours). This has also caused discourse amongst R&F staff. I feel there is too many middle management positions, which is preventing staff from receiving consistent direction and guidance. Decision making is taking longer which cause more delays.

I’ve worked on teams where no one wanted to take responsibility for signing off on a public-facing document, so it kept getting pushed higher and higher to people who didn’t have the time to review it. That creates unnecessary bottlenecks.  On my current team, we’ve set clearer expectations: which types of documents need executive-level review, which can be approved by managers, and which can move forward at staff level. Everyone understands the process and the expectations, which has made things much more efficient.  We’ve also improved our editing and reviewing etiquette. Instead of slowing things down with multiple rounds of small changes, reviewers will often give feedback like, “Next time you do something like this, try it this way,” rather than holding up the current draft for minor points. That balance helps us get important materials out the door quickly, while still improving quality over time.",

Managers need to jump through far too many hoops for progressive discipline with potential legal backlash, and even that doesn't provide sustainable results for improving staff productivity.   We need the ability to terminate staff that continuously fail to meet the expectations of their duties. For example, if there are at least three documented conversations about the same issue, managers should be able to move forward with termination instead of issuing a Letter of Instruction (LOI). The truth is that a lot of managers are hesitant to issue LOIs because these can hinder that staff's ability to leave their current role for another position. This means that the problematic staff won't be moving anywhere and will continue to be a problem in the current unit. Staff like this bring down morale and create more work for others on their teams. This inefficiency is costly and fiscally irresponsible to State funding, and hence, to California taxpayers.",

If they were not, I would mail them the appropriate forms to release interest, but if they were, I would inform them how we would move forward to exchange the plates. The reason why I did this was because we were closed, people could not come in to pick up plates, yet the plates were still being mailed to us. That posed the problem of having a flood of inventory, and not enough secure locations to retain the personalized plates.  This process was observed by one of our Regional Managers, who ended up implementing it within our region. She then went on to present it to Sacramento, and shortly afterwards, my process was now being done statewide.

It would certainly help HQ better support the field if they had experience/understanding of the field environment.",

Empowering these communities allows for actual progress instead of the usual responses that are aimed at preserving profits for a small, privileged segment of the population. Indian tribes throughout the state lead environmental conservation efforts that benefit everyone. A great example is the Klamath River in which Tribes are leading restoration efforts that will benefit the watershed. The Black Panthers and other groups conducted urban pollution monitoring to show that Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities are exposed to higher levels of carcinogens and are at greater risk of exposure to other stressors (extreme heat/weather, poor air quality). The work that these groups do highlight the need for environmental protections that will benefit all people. Unfortunately, they are often ignored or persecuted. We need to go beyond box checking and actually listen to, and empower communities that have the empathy and will to cause real change.",

This could be in the form of parks, sponsoring improved education programs, donation to public transportation improvements, etc.   This would act as a mutual benefit to the company and the community, thus allowing reduction of civilian taxation, which would mean greater money able to be injected into the community by civilian spending.   Tax breaks could even be tiered based on the area and type of community investment(s) made. For example, a company who provided funding for a state-of-the-art housing development for lower-income individuals would receive a different tax break than another company who donates canned goods. Incentives could also be stacked, this way a company could, theoretically SIGNIFICANTLY reduce their taxation by providing extensive contributions to the community.   I feel like this would make more companies want to move to and stay in California; plus, it could provide a mutually beneficial way to not heavily tax residents while still enabling California communities to flourish.",

In one agency, management prohibited cross-unit dialogue, slowing progress and isolating teams. In another, annual surveys repeatedly flagged communication as the top issue, yet leadership insisted on injecting themselves in every conversation or discouraging communication with other units and divisions. Instead of seeking answers from the sources, managerial direction has focused on the interpretation of resources that often prove incorrect. These decisions negatively impact morale, cause frustrations in a job that would otherwise feel ideal, and reminds of the axom that people don't quit jobs, they quit managers.   Managers often lack subject matter expertise, causing delays and confusion. Many openly promote a “fake it till you make it” mindset, prioritizing their own job security over the work required to excel when serving the public. The solution is simple: empower staff to communicate directly and collaborate freely, hire a strong human resources team to handle all of our regular issues, and reduce the layers of management. We can build a more agile, informed, and customer-focused workforce.",

I will go days without having a substantial amount of work to do while specialists and managers are working overtime.   I have a feeling many of my peers are doing little to no work most days of the week and I believe there is a lot of waste here.   I believe our managers should empower and TRAIN the reps to be able to confidently take on more tasks.  It is taking far too long for projects to get approved and to closing. I am not sure what the process looks like to fix it, but it should not take this long and there is often no sense of urgency from anyone on the team.   I believe that many reps feel that they have the ability and the desire to play a bigger role, and they have the knowledge and experience to be able to do so but are often overlooked and undervalued",

My ideas to solve the state's budget problems would be to implement strategies to either increase revenue or decrease spending and improving budgeting processes. As for the high cost of living, housing, and homelessness, I recommend a combination of increasing housing supply (i.e., affordable housing), implementing tenant protections, expanding rental assistance programs, and lowering other essential costs such as public transportation and groceries.",

However, when environmental restoration projects are constrained by environmental regulations such that the project must reduce the scope (size, duration, etc.), or they significantly drive up the costs (e.g. engineering, compliance, planning) of said projects, the public funds (State and Federal) go less to the intended use, and more to the churn of bureaucracy.  There should be more streamlining of statewide permits or more exemptions for restoration projects, and these should inherently recognize long-term benefits of restoration projects outweigh short-term impacts that follow standard BMPs.",

This could involve presenting case studies or data that demonstrate the tangible benefits of these methodologies in similar organizations. -Training and Development Programs: Implement comprehensive training programs that focus on process improvement techniques, including Six Sigma. This could be part of a broader professional development initiative aimed at enhancing the skills of state employees. -AI-Driven Process Optimization: Leverage AI to analyze current processes and identify inefficiencies. AI can provide insights into areas where time and resources are being wasted and suggest more efficient workflows. -Pilot Projects: Start with small-scale pilot projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of new processes and methodologies. Successful pilots can build momentum and support for broader implementation. -Cross-Department Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between different departments to share best practices and successful strategies. This can help create a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. -Feedback Mechanisms: Establish robust feedback mechanisms to continuously gather inpu",

      "content": "The practice of posting a job position at the DLSE, which is overseen by DIR HR, is inefficient, and damaging to the agency. Often, a position is posted, when the current employee wants to transfer to another office. When this happens, members of the public apply, and none of them are selected because the reason for posting was just a transfer. This is a huge waste of government resources. The employee should be allowed to transfer without applying for a new job. Also, the public feels angry when they are not selected despite their qualifications, and they decide not to apply again because they know that internal candidates will be selected. The same thing happens when promotion in place is difficult to gain as has happened at DLSE. HR spends dozens of hours reviewing resumes, interviewing candidates, only to turn everyone external down. Qualified candidates refuse to continue engaging in the hiring process because they get turned down so frequently. I have seen this happen, and because I am an internal candidate, I know that the internal employee gets hired. We would save hundreds of hours of work if we eliminated these practices. We would also increase the pool of qualified applicants if the hiring process was genuine.",

      "content": "Problem 1 – Customer Experience From a customer’s perspective, the State’s reliance on mailed notices and mailed responses is outdated and inefficient. Californians expect the same level of convenience they experience with banks, healthcare providers, and private businesses. Mailing forms back and forth creates delays, risks lost documents, and forces residents to rely on slower communication when technology could streamline the process.  Proposed Solution: Require high-volume departments to offer an online option for submitting responses or uploading documents. Provide funding to ensure these systems are secure and user-friendly.  Gives Californians faster, more reliable ways to communicate with the State.  Reduces dependence on paper, manual scanning, and case management bottlenecks.  Aligns government services with modern technology standards and customer expectations.  Problem 2 – Employee Retention and Knowledge Gaps State programs are highly complex, requiring years of training to master. While it is positive that employees advance through promotions, frequent turnover combined with limited pay results in ongoing knowledge loss and operational disruptions.  Proposed Solution: Leverage technology and AI to improve knowledge retention and training:    Real-time guidance systems for staff when processing cases.  AI-assisted training that adapts to an employee’s pace and learning style.",

There appears to be no interest, energy, or time available to reorganize, archive, and/or eliminate this unnecessary data and it's an accepted nuisance that any file search results may provide both current and 25 year old documents.   I see this as an inefficiency for two reasons: the monetary cost of securing and maintaining storage for these files that by default are considered valueless and the obscuring effect these unhelpful documents have when trying to find information.  I think files should be audited more regularly to ensure content is kept highly organized and easily discoverable, with unhelpful 'junk' documents archived or eliminated to reduce what is being retained year after year.",

Since we've invested in the technology and nearly all events are virtual, we can reduce office space thus saving significant funds.

Allowing remote work wherever possible will greatly reduce the amount of money wasted on building leases, maintenance, repairs, electricity, internet, gas, water, office supplies, soap, cleaners, paper towels, toilet paper, etc. Remote work allows for a more diverse workforce and provides opportunity to rural communities throughout the state, mothers, and people with disabilities. It improves productivity by reducing office distractions and stress caused from commuting. For neurodivergent folks working in the office environment can be very stressful and  downright overwhelming. The sounds, smells, lighting, temperature, masking, etc. impact the ability to focus leading to more mistakes, work being done slower, burnout, etc. Not to mention all the physical, mental, emotional, and personal issues caused by the stress of it all. It reduces carbon emissions, vehicle miles traveled, traffic congestion, and safety risks by having fewer people on the road, thus reducing funds spent on responding to crashes. It improves employee morale by allowing time that would be spent commuting to be spent with family, friends, etc. Shifting to the electronic/virtual world wherever possible will speed up processing times across the board. Emails are faster and save more money than snail mail & provide proof of delivery. Happier workers = better customer service.",

Management often times is too afraid of losing their job or retaliation if they disagree with a higher-up or a policy that has come from the top.  Instead, middle management should be fighting for what is best for their employees (and thus what is best for all Californians-since they are almost always the same), even if that means upsetting people above them.  And Exec and higher-level management should cultivate and encourage dialogues and safe places to express ideas, again, even if it includes disagreeing with current policies that are inefficient, e.g. RTO policies.",

      "content": "I think one of the challenges that many departments face is a lack of staffing resources to provide this kind of support. Throughout the past 25 years of my state career, I have experienced several furloughs, and more hiring freezes and position sweeps than I'd care to remember.  Over the years, staffing resources have eroded away to the point that there is just enough support to keep the lights on. With each of these cuts, we lose capacity for the true in-depth training and development that is called for commensurate with the positions. This, coupled with being constantly asked to do more with less, means that many of our staff are hired and \"thrown into the deep end\". It is extremely difficult to get more resources to replace those lost to position sweeps/etc. In fact, many departments have even lost sight of some of the things that they 'used to do' because they have not been staffed for so long. This becomes a vicious cycle, as people get frustrated with the amount of workload and lack of training.   There has also been a noticeable gap in management training. Yes, it is required. However often times new managers start and are immediately thrown into fighting fires. The trainings turn into an inconvenience resulting in feeling even more overworked trying to make up for the time lost, rather than a respite to focus on growth and development for this exciting new career step.   And although this thought is unpopular, I do not think that Telework has helped this situation.",

The biggest hurdle to this would be getting ever department access to ML/AI specialists who could appropriately implement these technologies as well as training existing compliance subject matter experts on how to use these AI tools.

This approach could also pave the way for a vocational rehabilitation program for inmates, teaching ranching skills. A viable skill to make money and raise meat for your family. Some of the benefits: 1. Reduced Operating Costs: Using animals to manage vegetation eliminates need for fuel, equip maintenance, & groundskeeper's salary. 2. Environmental Sustainability: Goats & sheep provide a natural, eco-friendly alternative to mowing, reducing reliance on fossil fuels & machinery. 3. Community Engagement: Partnering with 4-H or FFA youth groups provides a valuable community outreach opportunity & educational experience. 4. Inmate Rehabilitation: A successful pilot program could lead to development of a ranching rehabilitation program, offering incarcerated individuals marketable skills & a potential path to employment upon release. 5. Fire Hazard Reduction: Regular grazing by livestock can help reduce build-up of dry vegetation, a fire hazard, especially in California's climate.  6. Security: A thorough security assessment is crucial to ensure that program does not compromise safety & security of facility.  7. Long-term Sustainability: Develop a plan for ongoing maintenance, animal care, & program evaluation.",

This forensic review process and account reconciliation would seem to be waste of State resources if the commuter is going to continue to use the same public transportation each month.

      "content": "As a State employee for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, I am constantly stunned by the number of people who have either never heard of the department or have the slightest clue what we do. This means that as a Department, we are failing in our mission. We need to be much more transparent and need to reach a wider audience, and I feel that a better presence on social media platforms and taking more time to hold public forums, media releases, etc. would be beneficial. Of course, this largely comes down to a lack of staff and resources, and also policies that seem to prohibit how and what information we can share. As a state agency, one of our core responsibilities is to be transparent with our decision making - but another part of transparency is sharing the excellent work that many of our state workers are doing up and down the State and why the public should care and be paying attention.",

      "content": "As a Californian and a state employee, I have seen how telework creates opportunities to improve efficiency and customer service. In my own work, I have streamlined processes that once depended on paper files, in-person signatures, or lengthy office meetings. By shifting these tasks online and coordinating virtually, I eliminated delays and reduced errors that came from moving documents between offices. This allowed staff to focus more on completing core work instead of chasing paperwork, which directly improved turnaround times for the public.  Another example is customer service. When working remotely, I am able to respond more quickly to inquiries because I am not losing hours each week to commuting. I can give residents my full attention without the stress and fatigue of traffic, which means they get clearer answers and faster resolutions. Many constituents rely on timely help, and telework enables me to deliver that without sacrificing quality.  Telework also fosters accountability. Using shared databases, secure online platforms, and video calls, collaboration with colleagues remains strong. In fact, it often becomes more intentional and focused. The ability to concentrate without the constant interruptions of an office environment has increased my productivity and accuracy.",

My experience is different, but I don't like the lies folks are allowed to spread about me or others I know, and I would like to see more hands-on training about this.  It usually goes that when you report it, you have a mark on your back and now you are a dart board for anything anyone dislikes.

      "content": "Primary Problem: When state departments restructure teams or redistribute workloads without hiring additional staff, employees are often left managing the same amount, or more work, with fewer people. This creates burnout, inefficiency, and errors. Team members begin to feel like they’re constantly behind, unable to meet expectations, and working reactively instead of proactively. Over time, this erodes morale and productivity, leading to higher turnover and lost institutional knowledge.   Before any team restructuring, require a Workload Impact Assessment from management to evaluate how the redistribution of tasks will affect timelines, quality of work, productivity, and employee well-being. This should include clear metrics such as workload ratios, task priorities, and realistic turnaround times and involve direct input from the staff who understand the day-to-day demands. Departments should also implement temporary workload support plans, and training managers how to support their team when they are taking on a doubled workload.   By assessing impact before implementing a big change like that, California can prevent inefficiencies caused by chronic overload, promote employee well-being and reduce the likelihood of good employees leaving, and ensure high-quality service delivery even during tough transitions.",

We know that some people learn and work differently (it is standard practice to identify our \"types\" when taking entry community college courses) and that should be applied in the workplace. The bureaucratic comments may be to blame for a lot of the unwillingness to step outside of our role to assist a coworker who asks for help or something like that. I have always been like \"we are on the same team,\" and will help any way i can but quickly learned that others are not like minded. Only in my state jobs though. I think rank-and-file employees have first hand experience and are kept far from the decisions about their own roles and what processes should be changed to save money.",

      "content": "Primary Problem Sales and use tax regulations are complex and often contain gray areas. True expertise usually comes from auditors who have dealt with specific, real-world applications of the law. However, there is no easy or safe way for auditors to share their knowledge across the department. Getting clarity on how to apply a regulation often requires layers of approvals, and managers may hesitate to elevate questions up the chain. This slows audits, wastes staff hours, and delays clear guidance to taxpayers.  Proposed Idea Create a safe, department-wide collaboration channel where auditors can directly share and discuss regulation questions with a large group of experienced peers. For example, an internal email group or moderated forum could allow auditors to submit questions and receive input quickly, without having to navigate multiple levels of approval. Faster feedback would reduce audit hours, improve consistency, and give taxpayers clearer answers sooner, all while fostering a culture of shared expertise and professional growth.",

Too often, the department is forced to burden the one person who knows how to do a certain task with training every newly hired employee on every step of that process, and field all follow-up questions, only to have the new staff member move on and be replaced by a new-hire and do it all over again.

This is sometimes passed off as \"nuance\" between projects but the procedures should be largely the same for substantively similar tasks and no task is so nuanced that it can not be documented for the staff working on a specific project. Training is often one person showing another with no supervisor oversight or written documentation, so failures in a process persist through generations of staff. Some processes are intentionally obscured to mask waste or inefficiency, where they could and should be transparent and streamlined. Much of our technology was established in the 1990s and has never been updated or improved, despite being obsolete. Tech staff retention needs to be addressed and change management for technology needs to be better handled. Rank and file staff needs to be empowered to learn and understand technology. By reducing turnover in IT, training staff and providing written manuals for processes, and improving technological literacy we can bring our processes into the 2000s.",

The team I supervise also works well independently and meets on their own to calibrate which I think gives them more autonomy and buy-in to do their work with fidelity, accountability, and consistency.  We also rotate assignments when new projects emerge, and everyone is always willing to chip in. It's all very team oriented.  We utilize teams to share projects where multiple people are working on it, since we tend to have connection issues with our network occasionally (both in the office and out of the office). It allows us to keep moving forward when having access issues.  For some reason, we tend to have a lot of internet or network failings when IN the office, so we also use flexibility to meet offsite to complete projects when necessary. It assists with morale, but also gets the work done efficiently.",

Also the image State Workers have, like they don't like their jobs so they make it bad for the public, like government employees don't care.   Government sector customer service and very different from Private sector customer service, we should incorporate some Private sector practices. We should show some empathy, we care.  HR practices, can't be one generic for overall state departments.  Each individual state department is different and unique, let them run their own HR.  Example, Tax Technician and Compliance Reps are in one big bucket and pay range is the same.  But a Tax Tech and Compliance Rep in a Field office learns and knows more then one that is in a central office doing one duty daily.  Field Office staff should be paid more and location should be looked at also.  Ones in Los Angeles cannot be paid the same as one in Sacramento. That's two different areas and cost of living, yet the pay range is the same.  My pet peeve:  \"We have always done it that way!\"  We need to change with the times and technology.  We improve on the technology but its not embraced, because we have always done it that way.  Not being open to new ideas and/or suggestions.",

In addition, the ordering time is outrageous.  Purchases go through many levels of approval before getting to the vendor and many times the required vendor's turn around time is 60+ business days.    Small businesses and disabled veteran-owned businesses get preference, and many times, these small businesses order from retailers like Amazon and then upcharge the State.

I am sure that the casinos would love to assist paying for it as well since you would be bringing revenue to their casinos with the easy access between LA & Vegas. It is also a lot of desert between the two cities. At least then you would start generating revenue to continue the project. Aside from that I would imagine there would be increased revenue for the city of LA as people from Nevada may want to visit Disney Land, Hollywood, etc. with easier access.

Think about it. If everyone keeps hand-writing mail station numbers below the previous one, and scratching out the prior one, eventually the envelope becomes full and has to be thrown away and more envelopes get purchased which wastes money.

This leads to a large disenfranchised population of workers doing the bare minimum since that is all that is required of them.",

Some CEA leadership not being qualified for their role and no way to address via HR or other pathway since they may be appointed. Poor leadership allows for poor moral.  Have noted leadership in some agencies unwilling to work with leadership from other.  While not the 'norm', it does happen and creates barriers. Would like to know that GO leadership encourages leaders from within agencies to work together and track for accountability.   I think that having a feedback loop that includes a 360 review tool for reviewing 'up' is really important for culture development as well as building trust within an agency. Even if some of the feedback sounds trite or personal, it is still feedback and encourages transparent conversations.   Encourage lunch and learns that focus on emotional intelligence and communication versus just via onboarding training. While not required as part of annual trainings that I'm aware of, could be promoted as 'optional and encouraged' - it is empowering for self-reflection and relationship building.",

It’s frustrating to work alongside individuals who consistently underperform or show little motivation, especially when dedicated employees like myself are paid the same or often less. This impacts morale, slows progress, and weakens the overall effectiveness of the team.  To address this, I’d advocate for a more meaningful and transparent performance evaluation process that includes peer feedback and self-assessments, not just supervisor input. Raises and promotions should reflect both tenure and performance, so that strong employees feel valued and motivated. I’d also propose a peer recognition program to highlight those who go above and beyond, and development plans for employees who need improvement. Finally, training supervisors to actively manage performance issues would help ensure accountability.  These changes would support a healthier workplace culture and better public service. By recognizing effort and addressing complacency, we can build teams that truly reflect the values of public service.",

Small businesses are marking items up so much that it adds up so quickly and eats away at our lab consumable/supply budget.

They are the middleman placing orders with the vendors. $49 x # orders equal a lot of money. Small businesses are taking advantage of the state it seems to line their pockets. Also, the time it takes to process orders through purchasing takes a month to two months. We are not set up to conduct research in the lab as a result.  When I joined the state many years ago, we had a limited $ blanket and we called the vendor directly and placed our order. We received our orders fairly quick. We need to have the ordering better streamlined in terms of processing time and how to save taxpayer $ and get rid of utilization of small business and be able to go back to ordering from vendors directly.",

      "content": "I find that the primary problem is that too many large corporations take way too much from the CA taxpayers.  Many were not eligible for PPP loans and there's not enough law enforcement so it encourages criminal and/or misrepresentation in obtaining free funds from the State of California.   Some corporations illegally or inappropriately received PPP loans based on the honor system and took PPP loan deductions in their returns.  If the FTB shared this misrepresentation found during routine audits with other agencies such as SBA to enforce those (i.e. large and publicly traded corporations) that inappropriately received funds, the State of CA would be able revive the income.  When CA funds are inappropriately used to fund profitable corporations during the panddemic such as PPP loans and online criminals continuously stealing money from the State of CA's IT systems, more law enforcement is needed to avoid the illegal loss of funds .  Rather than cutting state salaries, budget cuts, and other reductions that harm the State of CA and our taxpayers, we should pursue the large corporations and criminals that illegally received the funds in the first place.  Placing more security on our IT systems is crucial for protecting our taxpayer funds from continual hacking and misappropriation of funds.  Instead of hitting the CA taxpayers with more costs and illegal use of taxapyer funds, the politicians should invest more in our IT crime prevention to protect the State of CA & its people.",

In my agency, cronyism, nepotism and favoritism run rampant. The rules speak out against these practices, but it seems that the system has slowly evolved to where it is not designed to encourage them.  One of the reasons this happens if SPB has a rule that examination results are kept private, so there is no way to know the exam results of others who have taken the same exam, and it becomes extremely difficult to prove when others rig and/or cheat the system.  Another reason is the heavy reliance on job references, which seem to these days be more important than actual work experience and meeting job qualifications.  Get a hold of all of the dishonesty and restore actual merit in the merit system and you will have better, more qualified, reliable, knowledgeable and more efficient state employees. I am tired of having to work for \"the kids\" of former executives who do their absolute best to ensure their next of kin get out of doing actual work.",

It takes DGS several months to complete this process, even if it's for an emergency; DGS staff are unfamiliar with department nuances as they relate to their operations when needing a one-time purchase; and departments spend a ridiculous amount of time going back and forth answering basic questions from the one-time acquisitions staff as they try and learn about the need for the purchase, the department's business needs, etc. Why can't DGS let the departments still complete the purchasing process if it's over their delegation and just have DGS approve/execute the PO?  It would be faster for departments if they could just do it themselves, and DGS would still have oversight since they would need to execute the PO.  Also, if the purchase request goes through the DGS non-competitive bid process, why does DGS need to start from scratch and re-review the entire purchase from the one-time acquisitions unit?  If the NCB unit approves the purchase, isn't that good enough?  If an NCB is approved, can that just count as a delegation for the department to do the purchase instead of starting over again for one-time acquisitions to do it?  This makes purchases take several months when departments can do them in just a month or two. Sometimes these purchases are critical for operations and cause work delays until DGS approves.",

This is a major impediment to hiring equity. Second, the almost cartoonishly strict interpretation of MQs regularly disqualifies intensely qualified applicants. The staff responsible for interpreting MQs are not experts in the fields they are judging and frequently discredit intensely relevant work experience simply due to the use of a synonym; I have seen applicants with decades of relevant experience have it all thrown out for using a slightly different word on their applicant than what the exam/application reviewer was looking for. Same too for calculating time of relevant work experience. Again, this only serves to exclude marginalized applicants.",

This would save $ on equipment, consumables (toner +/- paper), and maintenance while getting more out of each individual machine (less environmental impact). While I understand that programmatic budgets are distinct, why can't programs pay a proportional fee for use of the printing/copying equipment like we do for the office space, IT services, etc.? This would surely also save programs $ on wasted toner purchased for machines that become incompatible, outdated, and/or redundant. Streamlining in this way would also likely make machine maintenance and replacement easier.",

If that is the case, I believe reference checks should be required for all candidates. Additionally, I believe the current scoring process could be improved. In some cases, employees with many years of service in a department are not selected, which can be very discouraging. I suggest eliminating the scoring system and limiting interview panels to no more than two members to help ensure fairness and consistency. 2. Supervisor Evaluation For employees who are not in supervisory roles, I recommend implementing a survey every six months to provide feedback on their supervisor. These evaluations could be reviewed by the CEA to help identify areas of improvement. I have observed that not all individuals in supervisory positions possess the people skills necessary for effective leadership, and this type of feedback could support their professional development. 3. Open Communication and Feedback All employees, regardless of level, should feel comfortable sharing ideas or raising concerns about their department without fear of retaliation. To strengthen accountability, departments should provide feedback within five business days of receiving employee input. Too often, employees are told that leadership will “get back to them,” but no follow-up occurs.  4. When hired at a new department proper onboarding should be provided.",

      "content": "We in State service focus on implementing programs that distribute funds to solve a problem.  Distributing those funds are often under a regulatory time constraint.  The internal culture leaves little room to perform the Project Controls used in the private sector to hold grantees accountable.  Project Controls track the money and schedule progress to hold stakeholders accountable.  The current culture is to assume everyone is honest and playing by the rules, so we can hand out the funds and solve problems \"efficiently\" by skipping accountability.  But leaving standard Project Controls out of the process isn't an efficiency; skipping a step in basic project management is a problem.  It is an invitation to some to commit fraud.     This isn't a \"poor performance on the part of some people\" issue.  It is a cultural habit in our institutionalized processes, maybe because we don't have to show profit and loss.  Incorporating the principles of Project Controls in our contract agreements with grantees - mostly invoice format requirements - is a part of the solution.",

This will result in the ability for the state to consolidate its building footprint into a few major buildings throughout the state which can be used for hotelling. Take the remaining buildings no longer in use and convert them into section 8 or subsidized housing for homelessness which will reduce the need to spend billions on homeless shelters/programs. Take the savings from those programs and rebuild the rainy-day funds. This will also reduce the impact of vehicle emissions with at least 100k state workers being taken off the daily commute throughout the state. Everyone wins. I understand this would require a lot of logistics, but if the state wants to play hard ball with state workers, then they could trade the 3% GSI (general salary increase) for permanent teleworking enshrined in major MOUs between the unions and the state of California.

Required reading can be assigned to state workers with a short paragraph essay on each chapter written by the state worker to acknowledge what they have learned. Acknowledging the history of vulnerable demographics such as Women, Black, Asian, Hispanic, LGBTQIA, and the disabled can help mitigate colorblindness, gender-blindness, and any feelings of resistance against understanding race and gender vulnerabilities. Required reading and writing can also maintain reading comprehension and critical thinking qualities which are rapidly declining even at managerial levels. Required reading and writing about diversity can also help to heal the injustice of native American genocide, racial indifference (and racism) against people of color, and gender discrimination that were unfortunately inherited from the beginnings of the USA nation and ensuing statehoods, California included. The book New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander is a good start. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is another recommendation. By remembering the history of how the USA and CA statehood came to be, we can repair and heal these centuries-old traumas and the recurring injustices that continue due to ignorance of and indifference towards marginalized communities and state workers.",

      "content": "One of the primary problems I would address is the outdated and fragmented database systems we rely on as state employees. The current infrastructure is antiquated (over 40 years old and is DOS), and because so many departments and individuals are involved in each process, with systems that don’t communicate with each other, it often creates delays and confusion. Even when tasks are completed promptly on our end, we’re left waiting for other departments to act, which can negatively impact the employees we serve. I'm speaking from within Human Resources.   I understand that there are efforts underway to create a new system, but past attempts have fallen short due to the complexity of the project. Training has also been limited to overly basic scenarios, leaving staff unprepared for real-world complications. When unique or difficult cases arise, there’s often no clear guidance or consistent answers.  To address this, I believe we need:  A centralized and integrated system that reduces dependency on multiple platforms.  Collaborative development of the system with feedback from front-line users during the build phase, not just after rollout.  Advanced scenario-based training that includes real-life, complex examples.  A dedicated support team that can provide timely and consistent answers when issues arise.  These changes would not only improve internal workflows but also ensure better service and outcomes for the public and our fellow employees.",

Lobbyists of this kind should never dictate how state agencies are run.  Ignoring substantive reports of happiness, productivity, and culture thriving in work from home environments depletes the trust we have in state leadership.  Ignoring the benefits of less pollution, less time wasted traveling, less money wasted traveling, decreased risk of workers' comp claims from being in the office, less money spent on parking, less money spent eating out, less money spent on childcare, etcetera ad nauseum because corporate/real estate tycoons aren't willing to evolve is punishing workers for having less lobbying power.  My solution is to not ignore the data and productivity results from the executives entrusted with running our agencies.  My solution is progressive and not regressive thinking.  We can be a leader for change in this country by setting a progressive example starting with how we treat state workers - the proof is in the pudding, WFH works.",

Being able to appropriately convey expectations in an efficient and effective manner is a challenge that I think we can all relate to in some aspect. Whether this means streamlining systems or revisiting process steps, I've long felt the impact of circuitous actions which, especially in repetitive tasks, limit the potential for more meaningful task completion, learning, and even have negative impact on employee engagement and morale.   Proper education in evolving with technology and developing less complicated means to accomplish required tasks enables big changes to be handled in a more incremental manner, which, in turn, allows more adequate training and mitigates the inherent aversion to change by offering what appears more like help, rather than a potentially overwhelming or burdensome addition/change to one's workload or processes.  This ultimately improves job satisfaction, thus improving morale and even reducing costs as work completion times not only reduce, but the ease and desire for employees to complete more work increases. Supplementing this with relative and engaging training invites staff to become more invested in not only the evolution of the process, but the overall objective(s) of the larger department/industry.",

We are constantly losing high quality staff because strictness of HR rules enforced means high quality candidates often fall outside the narrowness of the HR rules.  We would be so much more effective and efficient if CalHR could allow the flexibility they used to give to allow us to determine what are needs are and move around resources to meet them.

      "content": "This!  This is what I came here to say.  As a relatively new employee to the State, I’ve observed some concerning disparities in management oversight across departments. While I understand that some areas utilize tools like 360-degree reviews and engagement surveys to support accountability and continuous improvement, this is not the case in my department.  It is disheartening to witness talented and dedicated employees become disengaged or leave entirely due to unaddressed management issues. There appears to be no formal mechanism for providing feedback on managerial performance—no 360 reviews, no engagement or pulse surveys, and no exit interviews. As a result, problematic management behaviors often go unchecked, with no accountability or opportunity for constructive feedback.  The high turnover in the department should serve as a clear signal that something is amiss. Without systems in place to evaluate and improve leadership practices, managers are able to operate without oversight, while employees are left vulnerable. Since managers control performance evaluations and career progression, employees are placed in a difficult position where they may feel unable to speak up without fear of retaliation.  Introducing even basic feedback systems would be a meaningful step toward a healthier and more effective workplace culture. Doing so would not only improve morale and retention, but also support the professional growth of both staff and leadership.",

I often feel like I'm wading through molasses trying to do BASIC parts of my job. This manifests in too many ways to count, but a couple issues are top of mind:  1) The regulatory environment limiting restoration-- hell, even basic ongoing maintenance-- is stifling work when the need for urgent action is so high. The \"cutting the green tape\" initiative was good, but didn't really fix structural issues. For example, replacing a minor culvert under a remote road in the middle of summer when it's bone dry still costs $10,000 in labor before ground is even broken. Surely there could be a streamlined (no pun intended) process for this-- perhaps a straightforward checklist or rubric to determine if there are major concerns or perhaps statutory exemptions for which you qualify.  2) Basic tasks like purchasing and timesheets are so complicated that we literally need a TEAM of administrative staff to handle navigating the esoteric, bureaucratic backwaters of Sacramento. Even with their help, it's frustrating, time-consuming, and hilariously dysfunctional. This is don't have solutions for. Ours is a large and complicated state. I've seen too many failed attempts at systems integration to believe there's a single fix for this. It may not be possible to put humpty-dumpty back together again.",

Overlapping responsibilities, siloed operations, and lack of coordination between departments often result in multiple teams performing the same or similar tasks independently. Addressing this issue requires a focused effort to streamline processes, improve inter-agency communication, and implementing integrated systems that promote transparency and accountability. Reducing duplication not only enhances operational efficiency but also ensures that taxpayer resources are used more effectively to serve the public interest.",

      "content": "Allow state employees to work out of a state office of their choice.   The return-to-office mandate has created challenges for many employees—particularly those hired into remote roles. While some employees value in-office collaboration (myself included), requiring relocation to a specific office location is impractical and disruptive for many. Many people were hired for remote positions and are now facing the option to move to the specific location of their state office or find a new job. However, in many cases, employees live near a state office, just not the one affiliated with their agency. Forcing them to move or resign creates unnecessary turnover and hardship. Further, many offices that are designated for a specific agency/department are sitting mostly vacant because they have hired staff all over the state for remote work that do not live near their specific office. Therefore, state employees should be allowed to choose an office to work from, rather than office space being designated only for one agency/department. Providing more flexibility in where state employees can work solves problems for the employees who would like to work near where they live and solves problems for the state by filling currently vacant office space.   Side benefits would occur from this change by introducing state employees that would otherwise not meet, breaking down silos, and creating community based on location.",

      "content": "As both a Californian and a state employee, I strongly support the continuation and expansion of telework. From my perspective, telework directly addresses the two goals of this discussion: increasing efficiency within state government and improving service to the public.  When state employees telework, we eliminate hours of commuting time each week. That reclaimed time translates into more energy and focus for our work, rather than starting the day already drained from traffic. Telework also reduces overhead costs for departments, with less need for office space, utilities, and parking reimbursements. Those savings could be redirected toward technology, staffing, or public programs that improve government services.  Telework allows employees to be more responsive to the public. With modern tools such as secure cloud systems, videoconferencing, and shared databases, most services can be delivered as effectively, if not more so, remotely. Constituents rarely care whether the employee helping them is in a cubicle or a home office. They care about getting timely, accurate, and respectful service. By avoiding commute-related stress and delays, employees are better equipped to provide exactly that.",

We have staff all throughout the state, and charging stations (at least stations that work) are not always available to our staff. Also, it takes staff several hours to charge electric vehicles. The Ford Lightning electric truck can take up to 14 hours to charge, so while it's charging we're either down a vehicle and that workload or we have to force other staff in a gas truck to double-up on their route and we need to pay them overtime. The First Purchasing Mandate says that we can request an exemption from an EV from DGS once we meet our 50% mandate, but DGS says they're being pushed to put more state EVs on the road because of the Governor's executive order so they deny the exemption requests.  What are departments supposed to do?  Pay their staff overtime to do the work a person in an EV can't?  Pay for a hotel and meals when field staff are stranded because they can't charge their vehicle?  Rent short-term rentals to try and offset the downtime with EVs?  None of this is efficient, and it costs double.  Also, has anyone done an analysis on the cost of an EV vs the cost of a gas vehicle?  Usually about 2-3 times as expensive for an EV when departments are also facing budget reductions. This seems like such a waste of taxpayer money, to make government more inefficient and more expensive so citizens pay more and get less.  Can DGS be more helpful on exemption requests?",

      "content": "DGS makes it unreasonably difficult for departments with owned vehicles to replace those that constantly break down because of excessive mileage or such an extensive repair history that it costs more to keep them on the road than to just replace them.  I understand the need for DGS to review and scrutinize additional fleet assets, but why are replacement vehicles so difficult to obtain?  It takes DGS 3-4 months just to approve the purchase (and DGS recently said departments will need to submit their Fleet Acquisition Plans 60 days sooner than in the past), and then once a vehicle is identified departments find out DGS has updated the state contract and the replacement vehicle is no longer even available.  From the time a department submits a Fleet Acquisition Plan (April 1), DGS approves by June 30, and then it often takes at least until December or January for the vehicle to arrive.  So if a vehicle is broken down, a department knows it's going to take at least 9 months to get that vehicle replaced and they need to rent a vehicle in the meantime.  DGS only allows short-term rentals for up to 30 days, anything longer tmust also be submitted to DGS for approval. The long-term rental process for DGS, even in these instances, results in tons of justification and back-and-forth between DGS and departments and in the meantime work cannot be completed or staff with a vehicle must do double the work to make up for the vehicle shortfall. Can DGS streamline the replacement process?",

Structured rubrics with behavioral anchors and blind scoring could be used to reduce bias. Basically, show me the value you will bring to our teams.

Like it makes you feel like a hero or something? I dont understand either... Definitely a huge problem though and it is part of why the turnover is so high and then subsequently staff are getting hurt more often as there is more inmates than correctional staff, and its just a domino effect of safety and security problems. Yet complaints about this put you on the radar so everybody just does their best to avoid being in that spotlight. I definitely agree there is a lack of trust from exec staff to their ground level staff and they demonstrate more trust in inmates. It makes lower level staff feel undervalued when we carry alot of the tasks nobody else will do but are necessary for the institution and carry a lot of legal weight.",

Telework and statewide hiring in the early 2020s helped bring in skilled professionals from every region, but with pay falling behind the private sector, limited advancement opportunities, and new in-office requirements, we’ve lost experienced employees who carried years of institutional knowledge. Replacing them, if we can, is costly and slow, and the impact is felt directly by Californians through slower services and reduced program quality.  A sustainable solution would be a statewide Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) for state employees. CA already uses LRAP models successfully for legal aid attorneys and physicians serving Medi-Cal patients. Expanding them to all state employees would help recruit and retain talented professionals, keep expertise in-house, and strengthen the delivery of public services, like environmental protection, health care, and consumer rights, that Californians rely on every day.  Student loan debt affects more than 3.8 million Californians. I’ve seen colleagues delay buying homes, starting families, and saving for the future because their loan payments consume such a large portion of their income. Creating a statewide LRAP would not only help employees build stability and remain in public service, but it would strengthen the economic and social fabric of our communities.",

      "content": "One major issue is the lack of managers who actively manage their staff. This isn’t about micromanagement, it's about setting clear expectations, assigning tasks with due dates, tracking progress and holding staff accountable. Instead, agencies often hire expensive project managers, funded by taxpayer dollars, to direct the work. So what, then, is the role of the actual manager? Too often, it’s limited to signing off on timesheets, completing IDPs, attending conferences, and to often encourage staff to “get the work done when they can”, so 2-weeks later or never.   In my experience, when managers don’t establish timelines or hold staff accountable, tasks take significantly longer to complete. Project managers, on the other hand, drive progress and lead teams to results more efficiently than many state managers. If managers owned their empowerment and held accountable for directing work, we could reduce reliance on costly PM contracts and save public funds.",

Funding sources that were utilized decades ago will likely not be enough to fund the department in future decades. Hunting and fishing are still pertinent recreational activities for several sportsmen and women; however, the percentage of the California public that hunts and fish has decreased dramatically since the 1980's. The lack of funds coming from hunting and fishing tags has a direct impact on fish and wildlife conservation and management. At both a regional and statewide level, it would be pertinent for California state government to invest time and research into developing new funding sources for the department to support conservation activities.",

This has been caused by at least 2 different things: 1) RTO policies and refusing to listen to state employees; 2) poor management and bad leadership that results in inefficient or unfair division of labor. Leadership, starting at the very top, needs to respect and listen to state workers. When policies, like RTO, are implemented without any real consideration of how it will upend the lives of civil servants--that is disrespectful and will always lead to low morale. I have also seen morale be impacted by poor leadership and bad supervisors (i.e. ones that do not listen to their employees and refuse to pivot when needed, or just flat out assign work unfairly). Once morale is low, people will begin doing the \"bare minimum.\"  They will take very little pride in their work. They will not care about outcomes. They will be so stressed and they will lose their focus at work. This is what leads to inefficiency. When you have workers who are able to pay their bills comfortably (because they are receiving a fair wage), when they see management take on the hard tasks (because management is making more money and should be taking on the more challenging projects), when they are allowed to work in places of safety and comfort (such as their own homes where they are mostly shielded from inappropriate conduct such as workplace violence, racist or sexist comments, physical-micro-management, etc.), that is what will improve efficiency for all!!",

To address these challenges, I would focus on providing the proper tools and resources for each position, clarifying roles and responsibilities so staff understand their scope and accountability, and implementing a mentorship program where experienced personnel guide and train newer individuals.

      "content": "One challenge in California government is that well-intentioned processes often pile up until they become bottlenecks. Ezra Klein’s Abundance talks about “bottleneck deserts,” and that idea really resonates with me. We spend so much time on checks, reporting, and auditing that sometimes the work of actually serving people drifts further and further away.  One solution I’d like to see is the idea of “bottleneck detectives.” These would be small cross-functional teams—made up of staff who know the programs inside and out—tasked with finding the points where work slows down unnecessarily. Twice a year, they would sit down with their teams, map out processes, and identify steps that don’t add value. If a new check or reporting requirement is added, an old one has to be removed. The detectives would track and report back on what’s been eliminated, making sure accountability is preserved without building endless new layers.  This kind of practice could help restore balance: keep oversight strong, but clear the path so the real work—serving Californians—stays front and center.",

Ensure digital equity — designing services for all Californians, not just the tech-savvy. Impact: A government that is more human-centered, responsive, and trusted. 2. Modernize Laws and Require Continuous Improvement Problem: Laws and policies that govern service delivery are rigid, outdated, and typically reformed only after years of failure. Projects often stop evolving once deployed, locking in inefficiency. Recommendation: Require statutory/regulatory review on a recurring cycle to keep policies modern. Build agility clauses into law to allow agencies to update service models without full legislative resets. Mandate that all projects include a continuous improvement plan — with metrics, scheduled updates, and citizen feedback integration. Tie agency funding and leadership performance reviews to progress in modernizing both policies and services. Impact: Government laws, policies, and systems that evolve continuously with technology and citizen expectations — ensuring services stay relevant & effective",

      "content": "I would address the primary problem of departmental technology silos hindering effective digital government service delivery. Currently, departments solve similar problems other departments are solving or have already solved in isolation, resulting in inefficient and redundant workstreams. The digital service delivery is fragmented and inefficient, also contributing to a confusing and frustrating experience for Californians.   To solve this, I would propose the following:  1. Mandate Inter-departmental Collaboration: The state should create a framework that incentivizes and, where necessary, requires departments and agencies to collaborate on key initiatives. This could involve creating a statewide playbook and process that all digital service projects align and follow with a central oversight.   2. Standardize Technology and Data: We need to break down the technical barriers that prevent departments from working together. A statewide mandate should be put in place to standardize technology platforms and data-sharing protocols. For instance, all digital services should use a common API frameworks and be inter-operable. This would allow different agencies to easily share information, integrate services, and build a more seamless, user-friendly experience for the public.  By implementing these changes, we can move from a system of isolated, inefficient solutions to a collaborative, and cohesive government that is truly focused on better serving the people of California.",

Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) rely heavily on grant money allocated by the CDC or the State. Most of these grants appear to be formula-based, while some are competitive. Problems: 1. Funding public health by grants is not sustainable due to factors such as the end of grants and new policies. 2. Allocations are based on factors that don't accurately represent the real needs of each LHJ. 3. LHJs are not usually part of the decision-making process on how to allocate funds to address the diverse and unique needs of LHJs. 4. Strict guidelines on usage, limits the ability of LHJs to address the specific needs of their LHJ creatively. 5. Not all LHJs possess the skillset and resources to compete fairly for competitive grants distributed by the CDC or CDPH. Proposed solutions include: 1. Updating allocation methodologies with modern economic models that incorporate factors representing real needs and adjusting for population variations. 2. Making the process participatory, allowing LHJs to contribute to the construction of formulas and the utilization of funds. 3. Building local capacity to secure merit-based grants. 4. Shifting funds from clinical services to Public Health, benefiting both Managed Care Plans (MCPs) and LHJs. I would need more space to elaborate on the details how #4 can be operationalized.",

      "content": "Big Idea: Streamlining Student Internships at State Agencies  Right now, if a college student in California—say, someone attending CSU Fullerton—wants to do an academic internship at a state agency like California State Parks, they face a long and complicated process. Their university has to negotiate a legal agreement (a MOU) with the agency, often involving lawyers on both sides. This process can take months and discourages students and agencies from even trying.  My proposal: The Department of General Services (DGS) should create a blanket MOU that covers academic internships between all California public college systems (Community Colleges, CSU, and UC) and all state agencies. This would eliminate the need for each university and agency to negotiate separate legal agreements every time a student wants to intern.  Agencies would still define the details of each internship—like duties, schedules, and supervision—but the legal framework would already be in place.  This would: - Make it easier for students to gain hands-on experience in public service. - Reduce administrative burden for both colleges and agencies. - Create a clear recruitment pathway for state agencies to identify and develop future talent. - Expose students to careers in public service, helping build a stronger, more diverse pipeline into government work.",

The first thing I would do is get rid of or upgrade the two outdated Call Report forms we utilize and condense it to only one upgraded Call Report form that can be downloaded from NMLS and uploaded to our MTFD database. Before the transition to NMLS ( Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry), the licensee was only required to submit one Call Report form. This form was powered by Microsoft Excel with macros built in.  The form was very glitchy and required the licensee to make multiple submissions at times when the wrong button was selected or the form was saved improperly. Now, the licensee must submit two Call Reports, one in an Excel format and the other using the NMLS format. The NMLS Call Report no longer has the built in error checking or data validation of the original Call Report. So now examiners have to waste time having the licensee correct and resubmit Call Reports for minor housekeeping issues. For example, the Outstanding Transmission Liability should agree on both the Balance Sheet Page and Permissible Investment Page. In the past, the Call Report could not be saved or submitted until the corresponding amounts are in agreement. Further, the NMLS Call Report should be updated to reflect both year to date balances and quarter-to-date balances. The licensee should not have to submit a second Call Report with this information.",

Like Salesforce, ASANA, or other type of communication database. 3) Approval processes are multi-layer and take WAY too long often causing work to be delayed.

The degrees of separation from staff to leadership continue to create large gaps in efficiencies and agile communication. Young innovative professionals often are left without a platform to grow and further develop innovative qualities.  Meanwhile, staff are promoted in place to management without the necessary qualities of good leadership resulting in cultural inconsistencies from agency to agency, even from branch to branch. Additionally, little to no recourse for nonviolent conflict resolution works because of these cultural inconsistencies, and as a result, I see regular struggle between staff, middle management, and HR with supporting the state's mission, vision, and values.  Leading by transparency is the way to remain a leader in these new technological age, and I do hope that the changes necessary may still lie ahead.",

Even within the same department, different offices often perform the same tasks in completely different ways. This creates confusion, inconsistent training, and inefficiencies. There is also a widespread lack of clear and accessible documentation for processes and procedures. Without it, onboarding is more difficult, and new employees spend unnecessary time trying to figure out how to complete routine tasks.  There is also very little collaboration or sharing of knowledge between departments. When I have reached out for guidance or documentation, I rarely receive a response, and when I do, it is often not useful. It can feel like departments are operating in silos, keeping information to themselves instead of working together. I think focusing on standardizing processes and building a more open, collaborative culture would significantly improve how effectively we function as a state.",

      "content": "Two of the biggest problems I've come across in State Employment in three different departments are closely related. These problems are the the lack of standardized training, and that the allocated number of job positions do not scale based on each office's workload. The number of staff available to give effective training is impacted by the face that the number of staff in each office within the same department, branch, and division is not scaled for the workload within their respective jurisdictions. For example, every office has the same number of AGPAs and PT IIs while 35% of the offices had at least double the workload within their respective jurisdictions than the rest of the offices. Unbalanced workloads between two locations will lead to the loss in retention of staff. This eventually will require training for new staff that replace those employees that leave a busier office. When there isn't standardized training each employee, and office, will come up with processes that may be incorrect. Eventually an audit may be completed and the staff in the office find out after the audit that they were incorrectly trained and things have been processed incorrectly. Some of the shortcuts in processes occur because there is a lack of staff, which ties back to the issue of job positions not scaling based on workload.",

This department was DFPI, and some days I felt like my team forgot I even worked there.  I would go days without hearing from my manager.  And then I would need to fill out FOUR different forms with hour by hour how I spent my day.  I felt like I was completely underutilized and undervalued at this position and was happy to get on with my new department.  Since my time with my current department, I have not had a lot of ability to improve these things, but what I feel has been most helpful is just being available to my peers, helping when people need it, and being a resource.  I go days on my current team where I do not have any interaction with my manager, and I feel that this is a poor way to run a team.  We should be checking in with each other daily, understanding what is on each others plates and supporting each other.  I get this from my peers but not so much my manager directly.",

Extensive research has shown that cutting Medicaid coverage leads to worse health and increased risk of premature mortality. As a possible solution, the State of California could implement corresponding state-level tax increases to partially backfill federal safety net cuts. Since some of these cuts won’t take effect for a couple of years, there is the possibility that the control of the House and Senate could change in 2026, and then legislation could be passed to undue some of the federal cuts to Medicaid. Time will tell whether these cuts will have the devastating impact they are intended to have on people’s health.",

      "content": "As a newer state employee with prior experience in the private sector, I have noticed a significant gap in leadership style and workplace culture. Too often, leadership at the state seems to operate from a place of fear rather than support. Leaders seem to focus on blame, micromanagement, and unclear expectations rather than encouragement, collaboration, and clear communication. It feels as though i'm working in my parent's and grandparent's generation. This has created an environment where employees feel disempowered, disconnected, and hesitant to share ideas or challenge the status quo.   To build a more effective and modern workforce, I think California should invest heavily in leadership development and hold leaders accountable for fostering a supportive, transparent, and progressive culture. Leaders should be given the tools to lead the same virtually as they do in-person. Leaders need to be trained to authentically care about their team members, communicate virtually or in-person with kindness and respect, and engage with employees in a way that feels human and positive, rather than robotic and forced. With new generations entering the workforce, leadership needs to adapt to meet evolving workplace expectations. Shifting from a punitive to a supportive leadership model would empower employees to engage fully, collaborate openly, and drive meaningful innovation across state government.",

This could lead to discussion about how to optimize or implement more efficient and effective use of software, websites, and useful settings.

      "content": "PLAIN LANGUAGE INITIATIVE:  The Plain Language Initiative aims to make California government communications clear, accessible, and equitable. Too often, state forms, letters, and websites are filled with jargon and legalese that create confusion and barriers. By adopting plain-language standards, we can help Californians understand information the first time, reduce duplicate inquiries, and build stronger trust in government.  In the first nine months, the initiative would apply to high-volume documents such as forms, notices, FAQs, and websites, piloted in key agencies like DMV, HR, and EDD. Deliverables include a Plain Language Style Guide, staff training modules, rewritten sample documents, and a feedback dashboard to track resident experience.  Key objectives are to improve readability to an 8th-grade level or below, train 500+ employees, reduce duplicate public inquiries by 10–15%, and boost satisfaction scores by 15% within a year. With a modest budget of about $250K and existing staff expertise, this project is small enough to implement quickly but large enough to show measurable impact.  This initiative directly supports Governor Newsom’s priorities to modernize government, increase equity, and improve service delivery—demonstrating that clearer communication leads to better outcomes for Californians.",

For example, the State Water Board operates the SMARTS database wherein industrial permittees upload data throughout the year to demonstrate compliance with the General Industrial Storm Water Permit. Other BDOs operate similar types of databases.   The state should strongly consider a system to compare the applicable numeric values in the self-reports against the regulatory thresholds. Automatic notices could be issued to the permittee or a report could be generated and provided to the enforcement unit of each BDO. This would improve compliance and accountability, while also benefitting human health and the environment. The opportunity for facilities to \"hide and wait\" for enforcement would be diminished.",

The chatbot can ask specific questions and compile responses for analysis.  Scheduling and Reminders: A chatbot can help schedule appointments, send reminders, and provide updates on application statuses. This can improve communication and reduce missed appointments or deadlines.  Providing Resources: The chatbot can direct users to relevant resources, forms, and documents, making it easier for them to find what they need without having to navigate through multiple web pages.  Data Collection and Analysis: Chatbots can collect data on user interactions and common issues, providing valuable insights that can be used to improve processes and services.",

Telework also saves taxpayer money by lowering the need for large office spaces, utilities, and parking reimbursements. From my experience as a state employee, productivity improves when staff are trusted to work from home, and residents receive faster, more focused service. Expanding telework is not just an employee benefit, it is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to improve how the state serves its people.",

Most new applicants just want to work for the State—they’re not necessarily tied to a specific department. Yet, they’re forced to apply separately to dozens of similar positions across different agencies, which wastes time and creates unnecessary competition between departments for the same talent.  Here’s a better approach: consolidate analyst hiring into a general pool. The State could recruit analyst generalists centrally, then place them at agencies based on need, fit, and interest. This would streamline hiring, reduce duplication, and help agencies fill roles faster with qualified candidates.  It’s time to rethink recruitment as a statewide strategy, not a department-by-department scramble.",

Currently state buildings are given an allotment that is the same year after year. The allotment is not calculated by taking any factors into consideration like inflation, rising interest rates, cost of living increases.  The process has slowly driven state buildings into the ground. Old carpet, failing and obsolete building systems all adding up to energy waste and pollution.   If you owned a home and rented it to the same tenant for 25 years and put 2% of the rent back into the property in that time, what would it look like? Not good is the answer.  Currently DGS only puts back 2% into state buildings! That number needs to be 10% annually or more on older assets.  Convicted slum lords in California hover around 5% reinvestment and are put into Receivership Court by their banks. We can do better! Currently DGS takes 98% of the rental income and spends it on unrelated programs.  The buildings should get the funding they need before the landlord takes the revenue to spend on other things. The income from a building should first cover its expenses before a landlord takes profits. The practice of a property manager spending the rental income of an asset on other things is called Comingling of Funds. it is illegal and the cause of run-down slums. The plan DGS has been to run them down and then renovate at 200 times the cost of doing regular maintenance ovr time",

      "content": "CDCR Fire needs a complete reorganization. Currently, multiple fire stations operate independently, answering to Plant Operations or Wardens. Each station procures its own PPE, hoses, tools, and follows local policies—resulting in a fragmented system with no standardization or unified effectiveness.  While CDCR Fire Stations at correctional institutions primarily serve an educational mission, that role should not diminish their potential to be a valuable resource for the State of California during emergencies  With proper structure, CDCR Fire could become a valuable asset in California’s wildfire, flood and disaster response efforts. Instead, its lack of coordination makes it a liability.  A centralized command starting in Sacramento is essential. Appointing a Fire Chief and Deputy Chief, supported by three Division Chiefs (North, Central, South), would create statewide oversight. Each fire station would have a Battalion Chief supervising Fire Captains, ensuring consistency and accountability.  This structure would allow Division Chiefs to standardize regional operations and report directly to Sacramento. It would also enable smarter use of state funds, prioritizing purchases based on verified needs. Battalion Chiefs would conduct assessments, Division Chiefs would review them, and Sacramento leadership would allocate resources accordingly.  If modeled after CAL FIRE, CDCR Fire could evolve into a highly effective emergency response force—ready, reliable, and unified.",

      "content": "I work in a department that trains new staff to do their role within our agency and we have been working to improve onboarding processes within the agency for all staff. When I was first hired the agency in work for only focused on onboarding for one group of staff and not the staff that support our agency mission, today it is better with more training focusing on onboarding and training for all classifications within the agency.   Looking at current practices for onboarding and training is the first step to improving how an agency moves forward to training and retain employees. Training departments also need to understand the importance of surveys/evaluations in their training to get real feedback on how they are doing with their training. However, surveys are no good if a department/agency does not have someone to look at the data and bring forth the results of the survey.   The second step is to have good documentation of current and past processes used within the agency or department.  I have found the lack of documentation waste time and does not allow improvement to easily happen. Understand that people leave and how they do there job is important for the next person who will continue that role within the department. If the role is new to the department, have a clear plan of what is expected for the new person and the resources available to them.   The third step is to have someone assigned to new staff as a mentor. Make sure the mentor understands their role.",

      "content": "As a state employee, one of the most rewarding projects I worked on involved streamlining the Caljobs benefits application process. The original system was cumbersome, with applicants often getting stuck in multi-page forms and unclear instructions. I collaborated with a cross-functional team to redesign the digital interface, reducing the number of steps and integrating real-time error checks. This not only improved the speed of processing but also significantly reduced the number of incomplete applications, helping Californians get the support they needed faster.  Another initiative I want focused on is improving customer service through technology. Recognizing the strain on call centers, I helped implement an AI-powered virtual assistant that could handle frequently asked questions, guide users through common tasks, and escalate complex issues to live agents with full context. This reduced call volume and wait times, allowing staff to focus on urgent cases while citizens received quicker, more accurate support.  I also would like a spearheaded a pilot program to digitize paper-based workflows for applications. By introducing secure e-tools (ChatGpt for customers) and cloud-based document sharing, we cut processing time from weeks to days. This was especially beneficial for small business owners who needed permits quickly to launch or expand their operations.   Finally, I think there are so many resources out there and we are just not using them, most of them are free!",

      "content": "Overlapping and sometimes duplicative permitting processes across different departments create frustration with the permitted community. Specifically, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulates substantial alterations to or diversions from streams. Similarly, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards regulate fill discharge to Waters of the State. The State Water Resources Control Board regulates water diversions. Sometimes all three departments are involved in permitting a single project, sometimes it is only two of three, or only one. But in the case where all three departments are involved, there are three completely separate and independent processes for submitting the project description and receiving state authorization (not even mentioning the local permitting requirements that are also typically involved). Combined permits may not be possible, but having a single hub for applying for state permits could be a start. Alternately, creating better mechanisms to collaborate across departments (maybe shared office spaces and shared virtual teams) would be extremely useful. Sharing resources across departments in general feels like a win for the state and the various departments doing similar work.",

      "content": "Problem: Managers are overextended and lack the capacity to coach and guide their teams effectively.  Why this happens:  -High performers are often promoted to management based on individual success, not leadership ability.  -Many managers have never received ongoing coaching (distinct from one-time training), so they may be unaware of their gaps or the impact on their teams.  -People don’t know what they don’t know, so they’re unlikely to seek out coaching on their own.  Solution: Provide ongoing coaching for managers, including peer-to-peer formats. This isn’t about formal training programs, but rather open, topic-driven dialogue. For example, live forums could focus on a key topic, with breakout groups (2–4 people) every 10–15 minutes to discuss real-world scenarios and share solutions. CalSTRS does something similar once per quarter for their managers, so that might be a template to start from in other agencies. It's not required, but I think that's a misstep.  Why it matters: When managers receive consistent coaching, they’re better equipped to guide their teams, set clear expectations, and connect individual work to broader goals, ultimately improving team morale and efficiency over time.",

This creates confusion, delays, and sometimes discouragement, especially for new hires.  If I could address one thing, it would be to improve communication and access to information. I’d love to see a more organized, user-friendly internal directory or onboarding resource hub that clearly outlines what each division does, who to contact, and what training or career development opportunities are available for your classification. I think mentorship programs or cross-division shadowing could also be super helpful to give employees real insight into how other parts of state government work.  At the end of the day, I believe that better training and communication leads to more confident employees, better service to the public, and stronger teams overall.",

      "content": "The State's haphazard approach to RTO which includes dismissing telework is certainly a primary concern with my colleagues. The State's attempt this year to needlessly change to 80% RTO ended up with a huge amount of waste. Departments were moved around for ultimately no reason, and without proper research done. When an actual thorough study did come back, it was after things had already been postponed, and the study showed that telework saves taxpayers millions, and falls in line with California's goal of reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change. How many thousands of hours of State Employee time, and consequently, millions in taxpayer dollars, were wasted by this rushed and mis-informed decision? How many thousands of Employees lives (daycare, commute, carpool, home office investments, etc.,) were financially & physically disrupted, changed, and then changed back? All this because the State did not do proper research or go through proper channels. I certainly hope we've learned some valuable lessons and approach this issue differently next year. If not, there will be an exodus of talent, because a primary reason people come to state service is the benefits, and telework is a big one.",

This problem could be solved in two ways;  1. Short term, allowing people to telework from distances normally not practical to commute from will allow recruitment for office positions that are both hard to fill and do not require an in person role. This also incentivizes private sector surveyors looking to earn their License to join Caltrans for the hard to get office hours.   2. Long term, emphasizing recruitment in high schools and colleges through our JET and TET program will let us get people that would normally go into the private sector apprenticeships and expand the number of people considering surveys at all.",

Once technologists within the state are trained in these tools technology teams will not only have a more reliable and secure environment but also the ability to share how they built those systems via Git. Technology teams in different departments can fork/download the code that was used to build other department's systems and use it themselves, make/commit improvements, iterate to create other systems, etc. This can foster a more collaborative environment for IT professionals within the state service.",

The state of CA operates well over a dozen LE agencies and from my experience it greatly inefficient and the communication and partnerships with these agencies lack.

Less chiefs, less administrative staff, less police officers, better communication and teamwork and producing better outcomes. I know this is the better way because currently we have over a dozen  agencies who don't communicate well and especially don't even have the ability to communicate their locations or talk over the radio, so it' similar to walking through a house in the dark playing 'Marco Polo'. Look at Texas, Tennesee, Colorado, and Arizona. They have a department called \"The Department of Public Safety\".

A goal for one agency maybe in direct conflict with another agencies goal.  There are countless examples of this.  Especially when it comes to Environmental.  We (the taxpayers) want a healthy environment, but at what cost?  We (the State Employee) want to do the best we can.  However, typically, low level employees are creating processes that increase regulations, aren't customer friendly, and drive-up cost for everyone.  They are not looking at the consequences of their decisions.  In State government, \"everyone has a boss\".  Just because we have Directors and other leadership with a goal, doesn't mean they have the authority to dictate regulations.  Many of them make decisions on experience and \"the way it's always been done\", and that's wrong.  They need to check the big picture.  Sometimes decision makers require unnecessary actions and these cause issues for others.  A great example are Governing boards, such as ARB.  They have good intentions of cleaner air for CA, but at what cost?  Should CA pay $10/gal when the rest of the world is creating global warming.  We are not the problem.  It seems like CA always has to lead.  It would be fine if the taxpayers voted on those regulations, but not when decisions are made by unelected officials.

Working in my own home I also will not have to worry about workplace violence (something I luckily have never had to experience but many others have).

The beaurocracy is created to avoid risk, not create a good working environment.  One small example of this is coffee and kitchen supplies. I was told that it is against state policy to purchase coffee, filtered water, or even dish soap for employees. This is a little thing, but it makes such a big difference in showing employees that you care about them. I cannot imagine the public would think that employees can't have these basic office supplies purchased for them, when it is so commonplace in every other office I have worked in -- even non-profit organizations!   It is hard to do your best work for an organization that does not care about you. This affects efficiency because it affects employees' productivity.",

Then they promote people who aren't qualified to do the work at that level (because they don't understand the work and what it means to get to the next level), and before you know it, you have everyone at the top of the earning ladder and no one who can adequatley do the work. Promotion is important, but they should be merit based, because you demonstrate a higher level of compentancy.

      "content": "When I first arrived, I focused on observing, listening and truly understanding what was happening in our department. Since then, I've been able to implement positive changes that have strengthened our operations. One of the first steps was addressing the organization. I created a RACI Matrix and lists that easily track all that my team has going on. We now have SOPs for each project and staff update them regularly, which ensures consistency and accountability. I also prioritized cleaning up of outdated files, archiving older versions so the most current documents are always easy to find--nothing is deleted, just properly stored. This has made our system streamlined and accessible. I've also modeled simplicity and clarity. I encourage staff to think not only about making their tasks easier for managers, but also about how our work impacts our internal and external partners. That means avoid unnecessary complexity--do not force people to open multiple attachments or links, we summarize key information and provide references as necessary. Our department now feels like a well-run ship because I consistently listen to concerns, take notes, pay close attention to details and operate with a growth mindset that is always focused on continuous quality improvement. Much of my early work felt like cleaning up messes, but through the foundation, it allowed for more strategic planning. I've helped to create a culture of efficiency and accessibility, and respect for everyone's time.",

The main site could include spaces for disseminating information (e.g. statewide policy), posting training and job opportunities, hosting webinars, sharing news on projects and subjects of statewide interest, and collaborating/idea sharing.  This site is a good start but access to a statewide community should be automatic, not opt-in. I also believe the state would benefit greatly from further standardization of web/software design and a collaborative community of engineers. (e.g. having templates for commonly needed software, like procurement, inventory, appointment scheduling, marketing/newsletter, learning management, certification tracking, mobile apps, etc.) Agencies could then customize templates to fit their unique needs. This could make software more accessible and affordable, encourage development of the state IT workforce, reduce reliance on private sector contracts, and create a more universal user experience, reducing the need for training when someone changes agencies. Lastly, I believe data required/used by multiple agencies should centralized to reduce errors/discrepancies and time spent on data entry. A first step would be auditing existing databases to identify what data is being collected by multiple agencies currently.",

Although the tiny savings of each one person turning off a budling's lights or illegal use of State vehicles (two stories I remember reported there), those individual savings probably didn't pay for the cost to run the waste department, but I think we need something like that. The State Auditor/Whistly blower, I called once and they said, \"we are not Big Brother, we have 5,000 calls a year, you have to provide all the evidence to the State Auditor for us to do anything\". But as a regular employee I can't access my bosses' records, I can't photocopy the subject state records, nor bring a camera into the place I had another waste/audit complaint. I think in the long run, the state investigating waste, even if not quote fraud, would pay off in long term efficiencies and cost savings. Maybe like a Mello-Roos Tax, if a waste if found the Waste Watcher department gets a cut of the savings to help fund the cost to investigate. Then the Department won't be cut in the next hard budget.",

In one department, as a seasoned AGPA I was required to have every email reviewed that was being sent to an external source. Another department that I worked for places their AGPA staff in lead roles, facilitating and leading discussions with internal and external stakeholders and the management sit back and watch. These types of inconsistencies can cause people to struggle when they believe they are taking a lateral position but their level of responsibility dramatically increases in their new role, it affects efficiencies when AGPAs with multiple years of experience cannot effectively lateral into similarly positioned AGPA roles.   I believe there needs to be statewide accountability put in place in order to make the level of responsibility across classifications consistent. This cannot simply be done by reviewing duty statements which are broad and do not often reflect the management culture of the office. There should be statewide reviews of internal procedures for varying classifications to ensure that state workers are paid for the same level of responsibility, effort, and commitment.",

This limitation not only slows down innovation but also prevents us from serving our communities with the efficiency, creativity, and responsiveness they deserve.  AI, when used ethically and intentionally, is not a threat—it’s a partner. It can help us streamline repetitive tasks, generate accessible content, analyze data for equity gaps, and even support inclusive language in public communications. These are not luxuries; they are necessities in a modern public service environment. To solve this, I would propose a pilot program that allows the use of AI tools within a secure, policy-guided framework. We could start with low-risk applications—like summarizing meeting notes, drafting outreach materials, or organizing project timelines—and build trust through transparency and training. My vision is not just to adopt technology, but to steward it wisely. With the right guardrails, AI can become a tool for justice, clarity, and care—reflecting the very heart of public service.",

Politicians pushing their objectives and the people making the rules and regulations have either never done the work or haven't done it in so long they do not understand the impact of the policies and procedures, or whether it will make sense to the end user applying the rule. Which also impacts having qualified training (or lack thereof). State training is normally developed and administered by people who are far removed from having done the work. Maybe there should be more in person, role-based training with SME's to assist. Maybe if each department had 1 non-management person (kind of like a SB/DVBE advocate) from each department/agency be a procurement representative to present department issues at a bimonthly forum (like SCAN).   There should procurement meetings for the department/agency representatives where new laws that have been enacted can be reviewed to ensure understanding where they can have a voice to speak about how those are impacting their jobs, etc.",

I feel when this happens it just happen it becomes a snowball effect.

This includes the software used to input information, management approval process, and revision of forms that need to be resubmitted.  Expense reporting, including receipt submission should be done all electronically (rather than having a requirement to hard mail in forms that can get lost).  The process for expense report is not intuitive and expense reports often get rejected, resulting in additional staff to correct these forms and correspond with reviewers.  An updated program, even if one created by a vendor, should be used for this.  The systems used for time accounting is very outdated and clunky.  I have used much better time accounting systems in previous jobs, which require less time to complete and are easier to use.  State vehicle maintenance is a nightmare - there is no fleet maintenance program for our state vehicle - we are required to track maintenance ourselves.  Getting repairs done is difficult, even if the repair is urgent, requiring us get procurement approval for the repair and to use a very limited number of maintenance shops in our area.  In addition, we have to use multiple maintenance shops (one for tires, another for battery change out), which are typically about 20-40 miles away from our office and require staff to lose at least half a day to wait for these repairs.",

Although many PIs work full-time for years, they do not receive the same benefits as their permanent counterparts, including boot allowances, regular pay dates, or timely raises. They are also last in line for overtime, unable to post and bid for jobs, and even when serving as lead workers, are not permitted to step in as temporary supervisors. Having spent 24 years as an electrician in the private sector, I can see how this inequity discourages skilled workers from staying with the state.

Federal Program Monitoring (FPM)  My most significant contribution has been leading the redesign of our Federal Program Monitoring approach, moving from a compliance-focused audit model to a capacity-building partnership framework. Previously, the FPM process created significant anxiety among LEAs, with extensive document requests and adversarial site visits that consumed enormous staff time on both sides while providing limited educational value. A key component of this transformation involved conducting a comprehensive review of existing FPM requirements to identify regulatory overreach. After systematically analyzing our monitoring protocols, several questionable requirements were brought to the legal team for review. This process resulted in the elimination of multiple requirements that exceeded our statutory authority and created unnecessary burden on districts without corresponding educational benefit.",

I often see representatives from various DCA entities at community resource fairs, senior fairs, etc. Outreach teams from different agencies are constantly searching for these events and trying to join them. We pay registration fees, go back and forth with organizers to arrange everything, and travel to different locations.  Why don’t we organize a DCA Consumer Protection Fair ourselves? As many DCA boards and bureaus as possible can join and set up a table/booth. Members of the public can attend and learn about all the resources available to help keep them safe, from how to find a trustworthy accountant to staying safe online, what to do if they were sold a bad car by a dealership, etc. A big issue facing us is that consumers simply don't know that our resources exist until we actively seek them out and inform them.  An Annual Consumer Protection Fair would be a great event for the public and help bring together the work that the Department of Consumer Affairs does in an efficient and targeted way. We could host it as part of National Consumer Protection Week (March 1-7, 2026).",

Offering those employees to reside in areas of the state with lower costs of living and eliminating their commute time and commute related expenses.  This would make the positions attractive to more prospective qualified employees and should reduce vacancies and amount of time vacancies remain unfilled.  Many agencies have duplicate departments or divisions and the agencies may operate in similar or adjacent fields, consolidation of the executive and managerial leadership, elimination of duplicate faculties, transition of appropriate administrative roles to more entry level telework classifications, will improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations, improve the quantity and quality of services delivered to Californians, and reduce budgetary spending for the state overall.",

The Governor has talked about consolidating some of those departments, but that's not really being done according to the mandate. The main issue is that those that are in charge of making changes have a big ego that gets on the way of serving California effectively.  For example, in the homeless issue, sometimes it takes 3 to 4 months for a homeless to be referred to an apartment and receive all the medical, mental and housing needed at that time sometimes it's too late.",

The system used to manage unemployment benefits is antiquated and the whole infrastructure needs to be modernized. Individuals having issues applying or accessing information about their claim are unable to speak to a live representative because their call center hours are extremely limited making it more difficult to reach a live person. Why can't call center hours be extended? With disability and paid family leave benefits, an individual is able to go into a local office and speak with an employee. Why was that option removed for unemployment benefits?",

These thresholds were understandable back before we had access to so much more intelligent technology but now it seems inexcusable to not be able to take more nuanced looks at peoples' life circumstances and backgrounds. We have all experienced hardships we can't control that put us ahead or behind the curve and those things aren't even that difficult to quantify now that we have 'big data'. If the private sector can use all that data to market products to us, we should be able to use that same data to better support our citizens. Why is it that YouTube knows I'm shopping for a t-shirt but we can't tell that someone is struggling to pay their bills? To be clear I'm not advocating intruding into peoples' lives but surely there is more we can do to ensure that when someone is experiencing a challenge in life, one of the first things they think of is, 'oh wait, what if the state has any options to help me?' We are a high-tax state and I suspect a lot more people would be okay with that if they saw tangible benefits of that money in their day to day lives.",

      "content": "Government workers are often drawn to state service because of the stability, flexibility, and the mission of public service. That’s why the return-to-office mandate worries me—it risks pushing people out and discouraging new talent from joining. I’ve already seen good colleagues leave or begin planning their exit, and we can’t afford to lose strong employees when recruitment is already so competitive.  At the same time, I do recognize that some employees don’t always engage or collaborate well when working remotely. That lack of participation can create frustration and fuel the push for mandates. But instead of a blanket requirement, I think we should treat remote collaboration and remote work etiquette as part of performance expectations. If someone is showing up, communicating well, and delivering results, they should keep the flexibility. If not, then their performance review could require them to be in the office more often.  This approach keeps flexibility as a competitive perk, while also addressing real concerns about accountability and teamwork. It sets a higher bar for engagement without punishing those who are already working effectively in remote or hybrid environments.",

      "content": "My experience as a state employee is that many managers—and the culture they shape—need a mindset upgrade. Gallup shows that office culture and morale flow from the top down, and morale is the foundation of productivity, engagement, efficiency, and retention.  Too often, I see managers: -Blaming staff for failures while taking credit for successes. -Struggling to delegate effectively, creating confusion and unclear expectations. -Avoiding leadership when it’s most needed, leaving staff to fill the gap. -Focusing on process over results, stifling creativity and growth. -Failing to empathize with staff as individuals, imposing unrealistic standards. -Resisting feedback, dismissing new ideas, or fearing innovation. -Managing by fear, micromanagement, or “command and control” rather than trust and accountability. -Prioritizing compliance and appearances over genuine outcomes.  The result is lower morale, weaker teams, and higher turnover. Spending the time to learn how to delegate wisely, listen actively, and lead with vision pays off with stronger, more productive teams. Far too many state resources are wasted replacing staff who leave managers—not jobs.  For inspiration, I recommend Simon Sinek’s leadership talks on YouTube.",

Over time, new employees receive strong onboarding, but tenured staff may not always get the same opportunities for refreshers or updates on evolving policies, technology, and our mission. This can create uneven knowledge levels and inefficiencies in how we carry out our responsibilities. To address this, I would advocate for a structured internal training program that includes regular refresher sessions focused on our core duties, our mission, and the ‘why’ behind our work. This would help reinforce a shared sense of purpose and accountability. Another problem I would address is the overlap and redundancy that can occur between agencies or divisions within our department. While each unit has an important role, sometimes our responsibilities intersect in ways that create duplicated efforts, confusion over jurisdiction, or inefficiencies in communication and data sharing. Additionally, I would look at streamlining redundant paperwork and leveraging technology to make our processes more efficient — for example, consolidating overlapping forms into a single digital system or using data-sharing tools between departments. This would reduce administrative burden and allow us to focus more time on the impactful parts of our job, like serving the public and ensuring workplace safety.",

Small landowners, community groups and individual applicants frequently face overwhelming barriers- long delays, unclear requirements, and inconsistent communication.

Meanwhile, agency staff- stretched thing and bound by unclear, outdate (some Basin Plans) - often seem unable or unwilling to help.  The system is not just slow it is inequitable. There are major structual issues driving the dysfunction: fragmented authority, a legal inablity to rely on sister agency reviews, and a risk-blind permitting process ( small projects get similar requirements to big projects).   These isuess can't be solved overnight but having a way to measurer the effects and inequities would be a start. There could be a few steps to start:  -Create share reivew systems across agenices so they can work together instead of having separate sources of data on permits. Identify repeated work across agencies.  - Change/update laws to let agencies rely on high quality review done by partner agencies. - Build tiered permittig process that matches level of review to actual risk of the project ( driveway, replacement of infrastructure without increased foot print), versus new industrial center). - Invest in accessible guidance and staff support.

      "content": "To build a more effective and future-ready State workforce, we must address outdated systems that hinder collaboration, innovation, and talent development.  Leadership Culture The traditional chain of command may suit high-risk environments, but in civil service, it often stifles collaboration and trust. Leadership based solely on tenure can lead to silos, disengagement, and missed opportunities for innovation. Incorporating 360-degree peer reviews and influence-based leadership models would promote accountability, humility, and a culture of shared success.  Classification System Our current classification structure, designed for factory-style work, doesn’t reflect the dynamic, cross-functional nature of today’s roles. It limits mobility, professional growth, and alignment with modern competency-based hiring practices. A shift toward a flexible, skills-based framework would better support recruitment, retention, and continuous improvement.  Technology Barriers Outdated systems discourage younger, tech-savvy professionals from joining the State. Investing in modern, user-friendly tools is essential to attracting talent and signaling that innovation is a priority.  These changes are critical to creating a more agile, inclusive, and responsive public sector.",

Naturally, this would lead to how to progress from AGSA, to SSMI; from SSMI to SSMII; etc. the training, courses, education, recommended reading. Another example, how to progress from Office Technician, to Business Services, etc. The classification roadmaps could include the Departments that have the specific classifications and recommendations for “assignments” as part of your career path, i.e., a new to the state employee may want to start at a smaller department, then progress as an AGPA to a medium department.  Granted this would be a massive undertaking and a classification duty statement can vary greatly based off the agency and its mission, however, I think it could be beneficial to provide that general path as some employees may lack the mentorship from their current department or supervisors or generally not know how to create a path to career within the state.",

We pay contractors ridiculous amounts to do work state employees could do and  the amount of money we pay for leases and office space that we proved was not necessary for 4 years from 2020-2024 is outrageous. Every department could hire more staff to do work for the people if they weren’t paying so much for unnecessary business leases. Additionally, forcing employees to return to office has reduced morale because employees have less money and time to spend with their families, leading to less positive customer service experiences for the public.   If the people delivering the service are miserable, they aren’t going out of their way to make that experience positive for the public.   Lastly, exempting employees more than 50 miles away but limiting their ability to promote is a guaranteed way to lose staff that hold critical institutional knowledge. When I leave my department as a result of this limitation, I will be taking with me the knowledge that only I possess. I support systems that save my department millions of dollars each year and there is one else in my department can support these critical systems.  It would take at least a year and a LOT of money to hire and train someone such that they can fill the gap I’ll be leaving behind.   I don’t want to leave state service but the governor’s return to office mandate leaves me no other choice because uprooting my family is not an option.",

The state should work with our California State Universities or University of California's in collaboration with Historians to document how each Department was ran and operated in previous generations (as well as our current generation). This would provide oversight and a framework for future generations to build on and acknowledge the overall direction of each department. This would also allow public record for our tax paying/voting citizens to have informed knowledge on what these departments have provided over the years, as well as give insight to how we can improve. This in effect would lesson reactionary politics and allow further positive growth towards democratically guided agencies in a show of absolute transparency. Some agencies like the Department of Rehabilitation have had leaders which fundamentally shaped our state for the better. Having that history fully spelled out for the general public would also strengthen loyalty and ensure that our leadership today and tomorrow can embrace the foundational values of these departments exist in the first place.",

      "content": "People often blame CEQA for slowing fuel reduction projects, but the real barriers are limited capacity, planning inefficiencies, and overlapping regulations. Even when CEQA has been waived—such as the 45-day priority projects or the 2025 Secretary’s suspension—we still must comply with all other environmental laws. That often results in more paperwork and delays than if we had simply gone through CEQA. For example, CDFW frequently requires a take permit, which adds 90+ days to a project, making timely fuel reduction even harder.  A more effective solution would be to create a 4(d) rule under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), modeled after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s approach under the federal ESA. These rules allow targeted exemptions or modifications to take prohibitions for threatened species, so beneficial projects like fuel reduction can move forward without lengthy permitting when impacts are minimal or positive. This is especially critical for California’s fire-adapted species, which often benefit from vegetation treatments.  Currently, CDFW offers Memoranda of Understanding for take, but these are case-by-case, drafted after listing, and far less efficient. A 4(d) rule would instead be established at the time of listing by the Fish and Game Commission, ensuring consistency and streamlining the process. Where federal 4(d) rules already exist, the Commission could adopt them directly, avoiding duplication and aligning state and federal protections.",

Do I have to/can I write to people who didn't get the job? Am I required to contact references? Can I give a verbal offer before I get the go-ahead from CalHR? Once when I was hiring, HR screened the applications, I interviewed people, chose a candidate, and then HR told me that person wasn't qualified -- that shouldn't happen! The whole process takes a very long time, and we lose the most qualified applicants because they start new jobs before we even finish interviewing people, or get the $ offer from CalHR. The confusion and lack of communication around the process causes extreme inefficiency and time wasted.  From the perspective of an applicant, the process lacks transparency: When will I hear back?; How high do I have to score on an exam to be considered?; I got a 95% on the exam, was highly qualified for the job, but I didn't ever hear a word from the agency or CalCareers after I submitted my application.

One example is my work on modernizing DMV’s data pipelines and integrations during our transition from legacy mainframe systems to Salesforce. I led efforts to clean, map, and validate large datasets into standardized formats. By automating parts of the validation and transformation process in SQL and Python, I reduced manual review time from days to hours and improved data accuracy before migration.  Another improvement involved documenting and streamlining the change request and deployment workflow for the DVM environment. Previously, approvals and scheduling caused delays due to unclear communication between teams. I restructured the process with clear ownership tracking, ensuring deployment jobs were pre-approved and ready for execution without back-and-forth emails.   I always try to improve collaboration across teams. For example, I created shared dashboards and data dictionaries that made it easier for both DMV and vendor analysts to trace field mappings and data lineage, cutting rework and confusion across multiple projects.",

      "content": "California's state agencies often have different interpretations of the same policies set by entities like CalHR, the Secretary of State, and DGS. This decentralized approach creates a lack of uniformity in business processes across departments, particularly in areas like Human Resources.  A recent project aimed to identify a \"golden image\"—a consistent, shared process—for the departments within our agency. However, we discovered that each department follows a different process for the same core functions. This forced us to develop a separate, customized IT system (SaaS) for one department and then hire a consultant to modify the code to fit the next department's unique needs. This constant customization is expensive, with each new system integration costing between $250,000 and $500,000.  By mandating a single, consistent interpretation of state policies, we could achieve significant efficiencies and save millions of dollars. A standardized approach would allow for easier cross-training of staff and eliminate the need for costly, department-specific customizations of IT systems. It would ensure that technology solutions developed for one department are readily usable by others, creating a more cohesive and cost-effective operational model for the state.  Furthermore, it may be beneficial to centralize human resources at the agency level and have one  HR system across the whole agency to save even more money.  This centralized idea can work for other admin areas as well.",

This could apply to many situations but one I've seen a lot is during regulatory development, the regulatory team does not always reach out to other programs like admin/finance, enforcement, community outreach, etc. They also do not always provide resources for those groups to help implement the regulation via positions or money. I would suggest improving collaboration across divisions/agencies, and doing so as early in the process as possible. This will also prevent needing to make as many changes to the reg or process in the future.",

It would be great if there was support for integrating contractors smoothly when they come on board.  My team acquired two IT contractors in the last year or so, and I wish some kind of training had been available to help set my expectations for what contractor teammates are like. They were highly skilled, but needed much more specific, hands-on direction than I expected. They also had different expectations for interactions and I think there was some confusion as to who their directions were supposed to come from.",

      "content": "Telework should be seen as a strategic system improvement that enhances organizational efficiency and public value, not just an individual workplace accommodation. Implementing statewide telework reduces overhead costs like office space, utilities, and operational expenses—freeing funds for critical public services.  Studies show telework often increases productivity due to fewer distractions and more flexible schedules. This flexibility supports better work-life balance, reducing burnout and turnover—key challenges for the State workforce.  Telework also expands the talent pool by attracting skilled workers regardless of location, which is vital for hard-to-fill positions. It enhances inclusivity by making State jobs accessible to people with disabilities and those in rural or underserved areas.  Additionally, statewide telework adoption demonstrates environmental responsibility by cutting carbon emissions from commuting. Less commuter traffic means public savings through reduced wear on roads and lower maintenance costs. Telework ensures government continuity during emergencies—like natural disasters or health crises—making services more resilient. Overall, telework strengthens institutional performance and public service delivery.",

      "content": "The system of CEAs, or Career Executive Appointments, and appointments to heads of government agencies is perhaps the single largest problem in California government.  The appointment of people with little to no direct experience in the work of an agency results in these CEAs hiring teams of consultants to advise them on what actions to take, which bill at rates of $400-$600/hour ($800,000 to $1.2mm FTE salary).  Then these political appointees hire people that they know who also are not experts in government or the agency's business and use consultants to teach them how to run the business.  Then, anyone with actual knowledge of the agency's business leaves because they're not valued and they see the waste all around them.  They know that they would make more money as a consultant instead or have less frustration working for an ignorant boss and being a punching bag for the general public who don't value the work of government either.   Many state employees are just contract managers and have little or no private sector experience.  The state needs to be serious about paying people what they are worth so they can attract real experts to run departments and to eliminate the system of appointments that destroys expertise.  Politicians are unwilling to pay for the true worth of a worker that knows what they're doing and instead they pay multiples of a true, market-rate salary to consultants and appointees that produce no actual work.  Furloughs also kill retention efforts.",

Background: Special Operations Assistant Chiefs serve as Agency Representatives (A-REPs) during high-impact emergency operations and pre-positioning missions involving: •\tHazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Teams •\tSwiftwater Rescue Teams •\tRegional Urban Search & Rescue (US&R) Task Forces •\tFEMA US&R State Teams deployed in-state or out-of-state via EMAC These deployments require rapid, on-the-ground decision-making and logistical coordination. Currently, the absence of direct purchasing authority via CAL-Cards limits the ability of Assistant Chiefs to procure essential resources, services, and supplies in real time—impacting mission agility and service delivery. The CAL-Card can be used for unexpected costs that arise, and that the assigned IMT might not be familiar with, such as the N95 mask needs for US&R Personnel during the Wide Area Search Operations at the January Brush Fires. Currently several agencies provide CAL-Cards to their supervisors, in some cases to Company Office",
