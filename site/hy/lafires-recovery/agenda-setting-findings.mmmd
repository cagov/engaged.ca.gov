# Surfacing top issues for rebuilding LA

People affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires shared what is most important to them. This will shape the community deliberations coming soon.

Over 700 people gave us feedback on 10 recovery-related topics.

The agenda setting phase for this engagement began in March and lasted through May 16, 2025. Participants opted in and shared thoughts about recovery from the Los Angeles Wildfires.  The information gathered will guide how public officials move forward. 

What we learned will also guide the next phase of this engagement: deliberation. 

The ideas and insights we have collected so far are invaluable.

## What we heard

We asked participants to rate the importance of 10 disaster-related topics. Participants used a 5-point scale to let us know how important it is to discuss each item further.  

This is the percentage of people who said it is very important or essential to discuss a topic further.

## Topics people rated

We asked participants to rate the importance of disaster-related topics. Using a scale of 1-5, people rated how important it is to discuss these items further. 

This is the percent of people who rated a topic with a 4, “very important” or 5, “essential”.

### What people agree on

People agree on a number of things that the government should do. The comments that people left tell us what problems they want us to solve and how.  

----
id: findings_agreements_1
----

**Environmental recovery and clean-up**

Participants want the government to do safety tests on the soil. They worry that burned materials will contaminate the area. They called for widespread testing and remediation.

----
id: findings_agreements_2
----

**Emergency planning and community safety**

Participants want the government to overhaul its disaster preparedness plans. They want the state to redesign the emergency notification system and evacuation plans. Both have failed, according to participants. They also asked for better coordination.

**Financial and legal assistance for housing and rebuilding**

Participants worried about fair access to financial aid, legal help, and housing during recovery. This is especially true for lower-income residents, renters, and vulnerable groups.

We are working with public officials to create recovery proposals. We’re also using what we heard from participants to set the direction for the actions we take. When we can, we are teaming up with efforts already underway to speed up progress and increase impact.

## What we're doing

**Continuing emotional and mental health support in the community**

Participants agreed that mental and emotional health support services are important. They also agreed that they didn't need to discuss this topic further in order for the state to take action. 

Participants stressed that the state should boost vital services. These services can help residents thrive once their basic needs are met. 

As such, California is building on its record of providing mental health services. More details to come. 

Agenda setting surfaced other areas, too, where participants are ready for immediate action. Participants said clearly that the state should improve emergency communication. They also said that economic recovery is key. We're using these insights and more to develop effective recovery plans.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress.

People shared different ideas about how the state can help solve community problems. This showed us important areas to work on, but we don't have a clear path forward yet. 

The next phase, deliberation, is where we will create alignment and find the direction we need. Deliberation will help us work through different opinions in a respectful way. Community members will be able to weigh the tradeoffs of different proposals. 

Our ultimate goal is to create action plans that community members can support and feel a part of.

“Homeowners should be able to use natural gas. It's more reliable and affordable than all electric mandates.”

“All housing should be built with no gas. We are supposed to be all electric in Los Angeles by 2035...so why invest in repairing gas infrastructure that will be obsolete/stranded assets soon?”

Should we rebuild quickly, or rebuild in a way that ensures lasting resilience?

header_1: Some residents want fewer rules to speed up rebuilding. 
quote_1: “Don't go crazy on regulations that significantly increase costs to rebuild.”
header_2: Some view this as a chance to change. 
quote_2: “We cannot rebuild LA without putting measures in place to mitigate these natural disasters in the future.”
header_3: Some people think rebuilding is a bad idea. 
quote_3: “We should buy out homeowners in these areas and turn unsafe zones back into wilderness. If they want to stay, they should have to pay for the true cost.”

header_1: Some people believe that the government should own utilities. 
quote_1: “We could rethink home insurance entirely. Maybe it should not be managed by private companies, but by a (sic) government agencies.”
header_2: Others favor the private sector with better regulation.
quote_2: “De-regulate, regarding insurance the insurance commissioner needs to meet with Ins companies, reinsurers, city/state/federal officials to propose a plan where residents are able to obtain proper coverage at a reasonable price and insurers/reinsurers are able to make a reasonable profit.”
header_3: There is also disagreement about who pays to restore and improve the infrastructure.
quote_3: “Edison should be responsible for this. Residents of Altadena should not have to pay” versus “Bury power lines and prevent costs from being passed to consumer.”

header_1: Some people emphasize individual responsibility.
quote_1: “Most of the defendable space requirements are already in the municipal code. How about actually enforcing existing code and fining people whose property are a fire hazard to the rest of us.”
header_2: Others stress the need for governmental and collective action.
quote_2: “I strongly believe in shared responsibility. As much as people want to rebuild as quick as possible, it's everyone's responsibility to build back to prevent the next great disaster.”

id: findings_key_tension_block_4
header_1: Some residents advocate for more density as communities rebuild.
quote_1: “Build more multi-family dwellings, eliminate the restrictions on duplex and triplex in single family zoning, build more and build everywhere.”
header_2: Others are concerned about safety and wish to keep the density similar as before.
quote_2: “Do NOT add housing density to this area. It is a high fire zone and cannot carry the density nor can the infrastructure”

## What’s next

We are working with public officials to plan the next phase of this process: deliberation. Participants will be invited to discuss the key opportunity areas. This can help them agree on how to move forward.

We will use what we learn from those talks to make a plan to help Los Angeles recover. 

We will post progress updates on this website.

## How we did the analysis

For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis.</a> 

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

AI was a helpful tool during our analysis, and our team checked all the findings to make sure they were relevant and accurate. We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.


**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
