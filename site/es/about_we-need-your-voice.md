In California, we know a strong democracy takes work. We build it through practices that spark conversation and solve problems.

With this initiative, the state intends to:

* empower Californians to have two-way, honest, respectful discussions on important topics, 
* let them be heard by government, and
* make better policy.

**Engaged California** focuses on meaningful conversations with the people of our state. We use the latest technology to include everyone. We value accountability, transparency, ethics, and facts.

What you think then influences how government acts on problems.
