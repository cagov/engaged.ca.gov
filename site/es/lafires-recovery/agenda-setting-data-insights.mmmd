## Agenda setting for LA wildfires recovery: A closer look at the comments

The agenda-setting phase of the Los Angeles wildfires recovery engagement is complete. We're now using the comments we got in that phase to shape talks that will help us solve important problems. You can download the comments to see what people said yourself.

## How to interpret these charts

Each scatterplot shows the comments that shape each of the opportunity areas outlined by our Los Angeles wildfires engagement.

The charts show how different opinions and priorities create opportunity areas for deliberation. People have strong but different views, but there are also some shared opinions that are worth exploring further, as seen by the clusters of similar comments. 

Each dot represents an individual comment. Comments identified by a large language model as similar are grouped closer on the chart. 

Each comment is also labeled with a subcategory. We used an AI model to define subcategories for each opportunity area. Each subcategory is shown in a different color. Grey dots indicate comments related to the opportunity area. However, they don’t clearly fit into any subcategory.

### How we built these charts
Methodology for creating these data visualizations:

1. Identify which comments are related to each opportunity area

We started by labeling each comment with which of the five opportunity areas (if any) it relates to. We used an AI tool (the Snowflake Cortex Classify Text Large Language Model) to do this labeling. 

2. Process and restructure the comments data

We used an AI tool (Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM) to summarize each comment. This also helped us see how each comment relates to the opportunity area it’s associated with. We did this to make sure we were focusing on only the most relevant parts of the comment. We turned those summaries into numerical data, or "semantic embeddings." These embeddings show the meaning of the comments in a way that computers can understand and use. We did this using Snowflake Cortex Embed Text 1024.

3. Finding subcategories

We used the BERTopic framework to group comments by similarities. This helped us sort them into different categories based on common topics. 

We reduced the dimensionality of the comments using a tool called UMAP. In other words, we used UMAP to turn complex data about the comments into something that would be easier for us to visualize. We used density-based clustering with HDBSCAN. We tuned the algorithm settings for each opportunity area. This helped us optimize how we defined the topics.

4. Labeling the subcategories

We grouped the comments by topic. Then, we used the 'Claude 3.5 Sonnet' model to label each group. Each label is a short phrase that reflects the main idea or viewpoint.

5. Plotting the comments

We used a topic-supervised UMAP. We tuned it for each key tension. This let us turn all the numbers into two easy coordinates. Then, we could plot everything on a 2D chart. The comments are color-coded by topic. This makes it easy to spot patterns and relationships.

**Data definitions**

These are the columns in this dataset and their definitions.

**Comment**

The full text of a comment submitted by an agenda setting participant. Comments have not been edited for clarity, content, or grammar.

**Topic**

The topic to which the comment responded. There were 10 topics. 
[Insert topic list]

**Key tension**

The key tension that is related to the comment
There are 5 key tensions
[Insert the list of key tensions]

**Comment contains an actionable idea**

Label denoting whether a comment contains an actionable idea. If yes, the field value will be [yes]. If not, the field value will be [null] or empty.  We generated these labels using an LLM and then hand-checked by our data team.
