# Agenda setting for LA wildfires recovery: A closer look at the comments

The agenda-setting phase of the Los Angeles wildfires recovery engagement is complete. We're now using the comments we got in that phase to shape talks that will help us solve important problems. You can download the comments to see what people said yourself.

## How to interpret these charts

Each scatterplot shows the comments that shape each of the opportunity areas outlined by our Los Angeles wildfires engagement.

The charts show how different opinions and priorities create opportunity areas for deliberation. People have strong but different views, but there are also some shared opinions that are worth exploring further, as seen by the clusters of similar comments. 

Each dot represents an individual comment. Comments identified by a large language model as similar are grouped closer on the chart. 

Each comment is also labeled with a subcategory. We used an AI model to define subcategories for each opportunity area. Each subcategory is shown in a different color. Grey dots indicate comments related to the opportunity area. However, they don’t clearly fit into any subcategory.

id: how_we_built
list_item_1: Identify which comments are related to each opportunity area
list_content_1: We started by labeling each comment with which of the five opportunity areas (if any) it relates to. We used an AI tool (the Snowflake Cortex Classify Text Large Language Model) to do this labeling. 
list_item_2: Process and restructure the comments data
list_content_2: We used an AI tool (Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM) to summarize each comment. This also helped us see how each comment relates to the opportunity area it’s associated with. We did this to make sure we were focusing on only the most relevant parts of the comment. We turned those summaries into numerical data, or "semantic embeddings." These embeddings show the meaning of the comments in a way that computers can understand and use. We did this using Snowflake Cortex Embed Text 1024.
list_item_3: Finding subcategories
list_content_3: We used the BERTopic framework to group comments by similarities. This helped us sort them into different categories based on common topics. 
list_item_4: Labeling the subcategories
list_content_4: We grouped the comments by topic. Then, we used the 'Claude 3.5 Sonnet' model to label each group. Each label is a short phrase that reflects the main idea or viewpoint.
list_item_5: Plotting the comments
list_content_5: We used a topic-supervised UMAP. We tuned it for each key tension. This let us turn all the numbers into two easy coordinates. Then, we could plot everything on a 2D chart. The comments are color-coded by topic. This makes it easy to spot patterns and relationships.

- Comment 
  - The full text of a comment submitted by an agenda setting participant. Comments have not been edited for clarity, content, or grammar.
- Topic
  - This column lists the topic a commenter was responding to. There were 10 topics. 
    1. Emergency communication
    2. Debris removal & environmental recovery
    3. Financial & legal assistance
    4. Emotional & mental health support

    7. Infrastructure & utilities restoration
    8. Wildfire prevention prioritization & accountability
    9. Climate & community resilience
    10. Evacuation & emergency coordination
- Opportunity areas
  - This column contains the opportunity areas related to the comment
  - There are 4 opportunity areas
    1. Should we rebuild quickly, or rebuild in a way that ensures lasting resilience?
    2. Should the public sector or private sector be responsible for utilities and infrastructure?
    3. Should fire prevention be an individual or collective responsibility?
    4. Should recovery efforts allow making space for more residents to move into the area?
- Comment contains an actionable idea
  - Label denoting whether a comment contains an actionable idea. If yes, the field value will be [yes]. If not, the field value will be [null] or empty. We generated these labels using an LLM and then hand-checked by our data team.
