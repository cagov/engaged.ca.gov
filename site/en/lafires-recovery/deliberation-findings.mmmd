# LA aligns on recovery plans

In a unique two-phase community engagement process, more than 900 community members gathered in virtual town halls to develop an action plan to recover from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. 

The action plan, developed through online deliberation sessions over a 7-month period, reflects priorities directly from those who lost homes and businesses. The priorities they set – focusing on immediate community support and long-term infrastructure improvements – will guide state and local officials toward full recovery.

## Noteworthy alignment 

People from different fire zones showed surprising consistency. Residents impacted by Eaton and Palisades ranked the top needs the same: bury power lines underground, improve water systems for firefighting, and ensure communications when there is an emergency.

This shows that regardless of geographic separation, there is community-wide agreement on essential recovery priorities.

**This group of priorities tells a clear story.**

Residents want both immediate support for recovery and long-term investments in fire-resistant infrastructure. They also need bureaucratic processes to be streamlined to serve the community's urgent rebuilding needs.

This engagement allowed us to turn personal experiences into real policy guidance.

**Building on shared support**

The process didn't just gather opinions; it built confidence and momentum as we move forward together.

While participants arrived with mixed feelings—only 24% started optimistic while 48% felt pessimistic—the outlook shifted through the process. 

More than a quarter of participants (27%) emerged more optimistic about LA fires recovery.

## How we’re responding to community needs

Residents spoke up during both the agenda-setting phase and our later deliberations. **State, County, City, utilities, and federal partners** have responded with tangible actions. And more are on the way.

Crews are already burying more than 150 miles of power, gas, and telecom lines in high fire-risk areas. **Los Angeles County and California** are seeking federal funds. This money will help residents pay for connecting underground utilities. **Governor Gavin Newsom** signed an executive order in July 2025 so utilities and local governments can fast track this work. The **LA County Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights that undergrounding is key to cutting wildfire ignition risks.

----
id: response_step_1_coming_soon
----
Utilities are working with **Los Angeles County and the State of California**. They are expanding undergrounding until 2027. Construction is beginning this year in Malibu, Altadena, and Pacific Palisades. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** calls for “dig once” coordination. The would allow fiber and gas lines to be installed alongside buried power lines.

After residents voiced concerns about weak water systems, the **Los Angeles County Fire Marshal** updated fire-flow rules. Now, 90% of homeowners can rebuild without needing expensive upgrades. **County fire crews and public works staff** are setting up portable pumps and tanks in areas with low hydrant pressure. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights these emergency fixes as immediate actions. Meanwhile, long-term system upgrades are being designed.

----
id: response_step_2_coming_soon
----
An independent review of the January fires is driving $30 million in new projects. We'll add larger mains, backup power for pump stations, and modern hydrants. **County water agencies**, with support from the State, will start design and construction in 2026. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** elevates these upgrades as critical infrastructure investments for long-term safety.

----
id: response_sidebar_2

During the January Palisades fire, hydrants ran dry within hours as tanks drained, and nearly one in four hydrants were outdated 1940s models. **County water agencies** are now prioritizing their replacement, as emphasized in the **Blueprint for Rebuilding**.

New rules from the **California Public Utilities Commission** require 72 hours of backup power at towers in high fire-threat zones. During the January fires, this kept most towers online. **County first responders** relied on their dedicated FirstNet network, supported by mobile towers deployed by AT&T. As noted in the **Blueprint for Rebuilding**, strengthening emergency communications and alert systems is essential to protect residents during future disasters.

----
id: response_step_3_coming_soon
----
**Los Angeles County**, in coordination with **Cal OES**, is upgrading its emergency alert system. Soon, evacuation warnings will appear in navigation apps, outdoor sirens will be tested in high-risk zones, and solar-powered resilience hubs with Wi-Fi and charging stations will open in 2026. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights these systems as vital for timely evacuations. 

----

**State and federal aid programs** have sent over $50 million in direct relief to families through **Los Angeles County’s Fire Recovery Fund**.  The program has waived permit fees to save thousands of dollars per household. It has also extended hotel vouchers and lowered property taxes on destroyed homes. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** says this support acts as a bridge. It helps survivors while they wait for insurance and federal funds.

**Los Angeles County** is launching a navigator program. This program is made possible through philanthropic partnerships and private industry. The goal is to provide families with personal support related to insurance, financing, and permits. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** identifies rebuild navigators as a major innovation to reduce barriers for survivors. We also heard that renters asked to not be left out. **Los Angeles County’s Fire Recovery Fund** includes direct rental assistance, and county supervisors are reviewing stronger anti-gouging protections for tenants in fire zones. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** affirms renters must be supported alongside homeowners.

The **LA County Department of Mental Health**, and local partners are using feedback from an earlier phase of this engagement. They are funding shared community spaces where survivors can access free counseling and trauma support groups. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** affirms that mental health services are a critical part of community resilience.

Residents asked for aid without barriers during the agenda-setting phase. **Los Angeles County**, working with community organizations, delivered direct payments even to undocumented residents to ensure no one was excluded. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights this as a milestone in equitable recovery. Also, the **California Department of Insurance** enforces a one-year moratorium preventing insurers from canceling fire coverage after a declared disaster, giving survivors time to rebuild.

One-stop rebuild centers are now open, where **County and City staff** from multiple departments sit together to provide over-the-counter approvals and personal guidance. **County and State leaders** have also waived costly non-safety building requirements to remove hurdles for survivors. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** identifies these dedicated permitting teams as a cornerstone of recovery

----
id: response_step_5_coming_soon
----
**The County** is preparing pre-approved fire-resistant home designs and batch permit reviews that will be available later in 2025. Surge staffing will be added if wait times rise. As noted in the **Blueprint for Rebuilding**, pre-approved plans and flexible staffing ensure survivors can move forward without delays.

Debris from the 2025 fires was cleared in just six months — the fastest large-scale residential cleanup in U.S. history — thanks to the **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers**, **Cal OES**, **Los Angeles County Public Works**, and emergency orders signed by **Governor Newsom**. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** notes this unprecedented pace as the foundation for rapid rebuilding.

### How we did the analysis

<div class="sub-head">For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis</a>.</div>

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.

**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
