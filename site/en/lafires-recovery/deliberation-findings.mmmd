# LA aligns on recovery plans

In a first-of-its-kind 2-phase community engagement process, more than 900 community members gathered in virtual town halls to develop an action plan to recover from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025.

The action plan, developed through online deliberation sessions over a 7-month period, reflects priorities directly from those who lost homes and businesses. The priorities they set – focusing on immediate community support and long-term infrastructure improvements – will guide state and local officials toward full recovery.

## Noteworthy alignment 

People from different fire zones showed surprising consistency. Residents impacted by Eaton and Palisades ranked the top needs the same: bury power lines underground, improve water systems for firefighting, and ensure communications when there is an emergency.

This shows that regardless of geographic separation, there is community-wide agreement on essential recovery priorities.

**This group of priorities tells a clear story.**

Residents want both immediate support for recovery and long-term investments in fire-resistant infrastructure. They also need bureaucratic processes to be streamlined to serve the community's urgent rebuilding needs.

This engagement allowed us to turn personal experiences into real policy guidance.

**Building on shared support**

The process didn't just gather opinions; it built confidence and momentum as we move forward together.

While participants arrived with mixed feelings—only 24% started optimistic while 48% felt pessimistic—the outlook shifted through the process. 

More than a quarter of participants (27%) emerged more optimistic about LA fires recovery.

Crews are working to bury more than 150 miles of power lines within the burn scar. The **County** and **State** are teaming up with power and telecom companies to plan for undergrounding. **Governor Gavin Newsom** signed an executive order in March 2025 to fast-track this work. 

Additionally, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order to help Palisades residents expedite rebuilding with fire-resistant materials and climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes hardening utilities for power reliability during severe weather.

The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** says undergrounding is central to cutting wildfire risks.

----
id: response_step_1_coming_soon

Utilities are working with **Los Angeles County** and the **State of California**. Construction is growing this year in Malibu, Altadena, and Pacific Palisades. It will likely keep going for several more years. The **State** and **County** are promoting a “dig once” approach. This means placing power and telecom lines in the same trench. It will save money, cut down on time, and minimize disruptions from several work crews.

The **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power** has filled over 80 water storage facilities to their highest level. Backup pumps are fueled and ready at each pumping station as a backup to the main pumps. They have filled their five water tenders, each with at least 4,000 gallons, and have them on standby for the LAFD if needed. Four reservoirs hold billions of gallons of non-potable water for aerial firefighting.

In the Pacific Palisades area, two local reservoirs are dedicated to aerial firefighting: the Encino Reservoir and the Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir.

The **Los Angeles County Fire Department** is working with the **Department of Public Works** and **6 local water companies** to assess the availability of fire flow in the fire areas. A newly created process will speed up the timeline. It will not require homeowners to be part of the process. And it will save them money. The **water companies**, the **Department of Building and Safety**, and **LA County Fire** will handle this new process. The **Fire Department** will update the fire code to meet current state standards. The **water companies** will upgrade their systems.
----
id: response_step_2_coming_soon

Water districts have identified damages and applied for funding (e.g., FEMA PA) to rebuild. The **State** and **County** have committed to helping districts rebuild and improve systems.

The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** calls these upgrades critical infrastructure investments for long-term safety.

There are new rules that require towers to have 72 hours of backup power. The rule was set by the **California Public Utilities Commission**. It applies to towers in zones where fire is a high threat. This kept most towers online during the January fires. **County first responders** used their FirstNet network, backed by AT&T's mobile towers. Telecommunication providers' continued investment in their infrastructure will improve emergency communication during disasters.There are new rules that require towers to have 72 hours of backup power.

A steering committee focused on emergency communication will meet biweekly to discuss blockers and progress. The group is made up of representatives from the **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power**, the **Department of Emergency Management**, the **Department of Planning** and the **Los Angeles Fire Department**.

The steering committee will coordinate with stakeholders from from **California State Parks**, **Los Angeles City Planning**, **Los Angeles Housing Department**, and **CalFire**.

Water supply system GIS layers will include water treatment plants, pump stations, tanks, and trunk lines. Evacuation information will feature the **Los Angeles Police Department’s** evacuation plans and tactics, along with specific Palisades plans and maps if available. Grid infrastructure and restoration data from the **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power** will be provided.

Finally, **Los Angeles County**, with local, state, and federal partners, will continue to review emergency notification systems. The focus will be on improving effectiveness. This includes implementing recommendations from 3rd party reviewers.

The government is stepping up to help residents. The **State’s CalAssist Mortgage Fund** is directing over $105 million. Also, there is $3 billion in federal assistance and loans available. The **County** has mobilized over $50 million to support families and small businesses. This aid comes from the **LA County Wildfire Relief Fund**. The **County** has also deferred or refunded fees for zoning, plan checks, and permits. This will help homeowners reduce costs. This applies to key agencies like **Public Works**, **Regional Planning**, **Public Health**, and **Fire**. These fees can be over $20,000 per household. More support has been provided as well. Section 8 vouchers are available for displaced renters. There are emergency shelter grant funds for persons experiencing homelessness in the area. Facilitated workshops are available for seniors with reverse mortgages.

**Los Angeles County** is working with the State and philanthropy to launch a program to help people navigate recovery processes. Families will receive personalized help with insurance, financing, and permits. The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** says navigators are a major innovation in reducing barriers.

Additionally, we listened to renters when they asked us to not leave them out. The **Los Angeles County’s Fire Recovery Fund** includes direct rental assistance. **County supervisors** are reviewing stronger anti-gouging protections for tenants in fire zones.

The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights the coordinated effort from **County**, **State**, and **philanthropy** to provide residents with “bridge funding” to cover near-term costs to survive and begin rebuilding that are not covered by other funding sources.


----
id: response_sidebar_4
----
Residents asked for aid without barriers during the agenda-setting phase of this engagement. **Los Angeles County** then provided language application support and direct payments through the LA Region Worker Relief Fund, including to undocumented residents. The county, with support from community groups, made sure not to exclude people. Also, the **California Department of Insurance** enforces a one-year moratorium. This means that insurers cannot cancel coverage after a declared disaster. Fire survivors have time to rebuild.

The **Blueprint for Rebuilding** highlights the payments as a milestone in equitable recovery.

The **County** has created One-Stop Permit Centers in areas hit by fire. This includes Altadena and Pacific Palisades. These centers offer residents in-person help from various **County agencies**. City residents can utilize the One-Stop Rebuilding Center at 1828 Sawtelle Blvd. County residents can apply for permits online using the EPIC-LA platform. This platform offers a unified application and review process. The goal is to make it easier to navigate. The **County** has also started its surge plan. It’s reallocating staff to meet its plan check and zoning review timelines.

----
id: response_step_5_coming_soon

The **County** is accelerating permitting and inspection through fast tracks. The **County** is also maintaining safety and code compliance while expediting rebuilds. This includes expanding the catalog of pre-approved plans. It’s bundling reviews for similar projects. It’s also increasing self-certification for licensed architects and engineers.

The **County** is increasing surge capacity. They are expanding the AI eCheck pilot with Archistar. They are also growing digital and remote inspections. Additionally, they are adding plan checkers and inspectors to manage higher volumes.

### How we did the analysis

<div class="sub-head">For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis</a>.</div>

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.

**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
