## Experts turned individual voices into shared data

A group of subject matter experts refined those ideas into 19 actionable policy options. They cover five key areas: utilities, community support, financial support, building permits, fire-proofing, and emergency preparedness.

comment_1: Homeowners should be able to use Natural gas. It's more reliable and affordable than all electric mandates.
comment_2: All housing should be built with no gas, we are supposed to be all electric in Los Angeles by 2035 anyway [...] so why invest in repairing gas infrastructure that will be obsolete/stranded assets soon
comment_3: Homeowners should be able to use Natural gas. It's more reliable and affordable than all electric mandates.

## How we’re responding to community needs

Residents shared what they need most to recover and rebuild their communities. <a href="#discussing-tough-issues">We found that some issues need more discussion</a>. However, we also found issues we can act on now.

Below is a summary of how we are responding to what residents said they need most. 

Stay tuned for updates on our progress. 


----
id: findings_how_we_are_responding_list
title: Opportunities to create new support programs
nbr_items: 9
item_1_title: 'Mental health support: creating shared community resource spaces'
item_1_text: As a result of the early findings and the feedback from participants, mental health support is readily available for anyone in need. There are many resources available now, such as immediate assistance, ongoing support, as well as care for all age groups and language needs. Those resources can be found <a href="https://www.ca.gov/lafires/help-for-you/health-and-safety/#Mental-health-support">here</a>.
item_2_title: 'Beneath the surface: our communities depend on soil we can trust'
item_2_text: Residents want soil testing to make sure they are safe from toxic chemicals after the fires. The federal government has declined comprehensive soil testing. While the state, community, and universities are proactively testing soil, confusion about who is responsible persists, absent federal coordination.
item_3_title: 'When minutes matter: reaching everyone in crisis'
item_3_text: Residents want one emergency alert system that works for everyone. The various systems in use now don't work together well and don't reach all residents. People suggest working with local community groups to help evacuate areas during emergencies.
item_4_title: 'Bridging the gap: financial support that reaches everyone'
item_4_text: Residents want direct financial assistance for all wildfire victims. They don’t think income or immigration status should affect eligibility. Right now, help mainly comes from FEMA, insurance companies, and nonprofits. There is no comprehensive state-funded grant program. An emergency assistance program funded by the state could fill in the gaps.
item_5_title: 'Renters in recovery: a place at the table'
item_5_text: Residents seek special protections for renters. They want to prevent forced evictions or displacement and financial struggles. There are some protections against predatory investors However, support for renters’ specific needs is limited, and there may be a lack of awareness of state programs that do support their needs.
item_6_title: 'Reimagining insurance: coverage we can count on'
item_6_text: Residents said insurance companies should offer adequate coverage in fire-prone areas. They said prices should be fair with simplified claims processes. Recent changes by the Insurance Commissioner have raised coverage limits and added discounts. Residents may need clearer information about these options.
item_7_title: 'Rebuilding pathways: simplifying the journey home'
item_7_text: Residents want an easier permit process and less red tape for rebuilding. Executive orders have already streamlined rebuilding. But residents don’t seem to know about these changes or how to use them with their local governments.
item_8_title: 'Communities united: empowering neighbors against fire'
item_8_text: Residents agree that they want fire prevention programs that teach and help communities. California has programs in place to address this. Residents may need more local resources, and education to use them well. There may also be a need for more funding to effectively implement the programs.
item_9_title: 'Building to endure: homes that withstand the flames'
item_9_text: Residents want to rebuild with fire-resistant materials. Yet, they feel confused about how to start. They think both individual homes and whole communities need attention. Fire-resistant building rules are in place, but residents may need more support. The state could help them by offering education, incentives, and further assistance.

### How we did the analysis

<div class="sub-head">For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis</a>.</div>

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.

**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
