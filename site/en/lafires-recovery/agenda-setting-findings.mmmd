----

The agenda setting phase for this engagement began in March and lasted through May 16, 2025. Participants opted in and shared thoughts about recovery from the Los Angeles Wildfires.  The information gathered will guide how public officials move forward. 

What we learned will also guide the next phase of this engagement: deliberation. 

The ideas and insights we have collected so far are invaluable.

### What people agree on

People agree on a number of things that the government should do. The comments that people left tell us what problems they want us to solve and how.  

----
id: findings_agreements_1
----

**Environmental recovery and clean-up**

Participants want the government to do safety tests on the soil. They worry that burned materials will contaminate the area. They called for widespread testing and remediation.

----
id: findings_agreements_2
----

**Emergency planning and community safety**

Participants want the government to overhaul its disaster preparedness plans. They want the state to redesign the emergency notification system and evacuation plans. Both have failed, according to participants. They also asked for better coordination.

----
id: findings_agreements_3
----

**Financial and legal assistance for housing and rebuilding**

Participants worried about fair access to financial aid, legal help, and housing during recovery. This is especially true for lower-income residents, renters, and vulnerable groups.

----
id: findings_agreements_conclusion

We are working with public officials to create recovery proposals. We’re also using what we heard from participants to set the direction for the actions we take. When we can, we are teaming up with efforts already underway to speed up progress and increase impact.

## How we're responding to community needs

Residents shared what they need most to recover and rebuild their communities. <a href="#discussing-tough-issues">We found that some issues need more discussion</a>. However, we also found issues we can act on now.

The support that can be offered to fire victims right now can be split into two groups:

* Opportunities for new support programs 
* Opportunities to amplify and improve existing programs

Many residents are facing mental health issues, safety concerns, and financial hardship. They want better emergency systems, direct financial assistance, and protection for renters. Finally, they need to know if their soil is safe. These are the concerns we are addressing now by creating new policies or programs.

Residents need help with insurance, building permits, and fire prevention. California already has some programs to help with these issues. But residents either don't know about them or find them too hard to use. Our plan is to improve access to the existing help and better share key information.

Below is a summary of how we are responding to what residents said they need most. 

Stay tuned for updates on our progress.

id: findings_how_we_are_responding_list
----
**Opportunities to create new support programs**

1. Community mental health support

Residents said they needed community support and places to gather after the fire. This would help them cope with being displaced.

2. Soil safety testing

Residents want soil testing to make sure they are safe from toxic chemicals after the fires. Some universities offer free soil testing, but federal agencies won't do full testing. There's no state program that covers this need completely.

3. Improvements to emergency alert systems

Residents want one emergency alert system that works for everyone. The various systems in use now don't work together well and don't reach all residents. People suggest working with local community groups to help evacuate areas during emergencies.

4. Direct financial assistance

Residents want direct financial assistance for all wildfire victims. They don't want income or immigration status to be a consideration for this support. Right now, help mainly comes from FEMA, insurance companies, and nonprofits. There is no comprehensive state-funded grant program. An emergency assistance program funded by the state could fill in the gaps.

5. Protection for renters during recovery

Residents seek special protections for renters. They want to prevent forced evictions or displacement and financial struggles. There are some protections against predatory investors. However, support for renters' specific needs is limited.

**Opportunities to amplify and improve access to existing support**

1. Insurance reform 

Residents said insurance companies should offer adequate coverage in fire-prone areas. They said prices should be fair with simplified claims processes. Recent changes by the Insurance Commissioner have raised coverage limits and added discounts. Residents may need clearer information about these options.

2. Streamlined rebuilding processes

Residents want an easier permit process and less red tape for rebuilding. Executive orders have already streamlined rebuilding. But residents don’t seem to know about these changes or how to use them with their local governments.

3. Fire prevention programs and education

Residents agree that they want fire prevention programs that teach and help communities. California has programs in place to address this. Residents may need more local resources, and education to use them well. There may also be a need for more funding to effectively implement the programs.

4. Fire-resistant materials for rebuilding

Residents want to rebuild with fire-resistant materials. Yet, they feel confused about how to start. They think both individual homes and whole communities need attention. Fire-resistant building rules are in place, but residents may need more support. We could help them by offering education, incentives, and further assistance.

## Up next: Discussing tough issues

While we are ready to take action on the priorities above, there is still work to do for some other issues. We will invite California residents to help us with this. <a href="">Sign up to stay informed</a>. 

Residents shared ideas about complex community challenges that need deeper exploration. These issues don't have simple solutions. They may involve difficult trade-offs that communities need to work through together.

The next phase, deliberation, is where we will tackle these more complex topics. Deliberation will allow community members to:

* Align and find the right direction to move ahead
* Work through different opinions in a respectful way
* Weigh the benefits and drawbacks of different proposals

Our ultimate goal is to create action plans that community members can support and feel a part of.

“All housing should be built with no gas. We are supposed to be all electric in Los Angeles by 2035...so why invest in repairing gas infrastructure that will be obsolete/stranded assets soon?”

header_1: Some residents want fewer rules to speed up rebuilding. 
quote_1: “Don't go crazy on regulations that significantly increase costs to rebuild.”
header_2: Some view this as a chance to change. 
quote_2: “We cannot rebuild LA without putting measures in place to mitigate these natural disasters in the future.”
header_3: Some people think rebuilding is a bad idea. 
quote_3: “We should buy out homeowners in these areas and turn unsafe zones back into wilderness. If they want to stay, they should have to pay for the true cost.”

quote_1: “We could rethink home insurance entirely. Maybe it should not be managed by private companies, but by a (sic) government agencies.”
header_2: Others favor the private sector with better regulation.
quote_2: “De-regulate, regarding insurance the insurance commissioner needs to meet with Ins companies, reinsurers, city/state/federal officials to propose a plan where residents are able to obtain proper coverage at a reasonable price and insurers/reinsurers are able to make a reasonable profit.”
header_3: There is also disagreement about who pays to restore and improve the infrastructure.
quote_3: “Edison should be responsible for this. Residents of Altadena should not have to pay” versus “Bury power lines and prevent costs from being passed to consumer.”

header_1: Some people emphasize individual responsibility.
quote_1: “Most of the defendable space requirements are already in the municipal code. How about actually enforcing existing code and fining people whose property are a fire hazard to the rest of us.”
header_2: Others stress the need for governmental and collective action.
quote_2: “I strongly believe in shared responsibility. As much as people want to rebuild as quick as possible, it's everyone's responsibility to build back to prevent the next great disaster.”

header_1: Some residents advocate for more density as communities rebuild.
quote_1: “Build more multi-family dwellings, eliminate the restrictions on duplex and triplex in single family zoning, build more and build everywhere.”
header_2: Others are concerned about safety and wish to keep the density similar as before.
quote_2: “Do NOT add housing density to this area. It is a high fire zone and cannot carry the density nor can the infrastructure”

## What’s next

We are working with public officials to plan the next phase of this process: deliberation. Participants will be invited to discuss the key opportunity areas. This can help them agree on how to move forward.

We will use what we learn from those talks to make a plan to help Los Angeles recover. 

We will post progress updates on this website.

## How we did the analysis

For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis.</a> 

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

AI was a helpful tool during our analysis, and our team checked all the findings to make sure they were relevant and accurate. We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.


**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
