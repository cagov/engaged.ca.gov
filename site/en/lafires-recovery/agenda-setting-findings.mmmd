[Engaged California](https://engaged.ca.gov/) invites the public to shape the policies that impact their lives.


The platform launched in January 2025 after the Los Angeles wildfires.


The first engagement to get community feedback on disaster response began in March. Residents from Altadena, Pacific Palisades, and the greater Los Angeles area took part.


The ideas and insights we have gathered so far are invaluable.

## What we heard

We asked participants to rate the importance of 10 disaster-related topics. Participants used a 5-point scale to let us know how important it is to discuss each item further.  

This is the percentage of people who said it is very important or essential to discuss a topic further.

### What people agree on

People agree on a number of things that the government should do. The comments that people left tell us what problems they want us to solve and how.

**Environmental recovery and clean-up**

Participants want the government to do safety tests on the soil. They worry that burned materials will contaminate the area. They called for widespread testing and remediation.

----

----

**Emergency planning and community safety**

Participants want the government to overhaul its disaster preparedness plans. They want the state to redesign the emergency notification system and evacuation plans. Both have failed, according to participants. They also asked for better coordination.

**Financial and legal assistance for housing and rebuilding**

Participants worried about fair access to financial aid, legal help, and housing during recovery. This is especially true for lower-income residents, renters, and vulnerable groups.

We are working with public officials to create recovery proposals. We’re also using what we heard from participants to set the direction for the actions we take. When we can, we are teaming up with efforts already underway to speed up progress and increase impact.

## What we're doing

**Continuing emotional and mental health support in the community**

Participants agreed that the government should support mental and emotional health. 

The state of California is going to continue its record of support by doing [content to come from GO]

Mental health isn't the only issue where participants are ready for the state to take action. People don't think they need to discuss these important issues further. For instance, people want better communication from the government in emergencies. They also think that economic recovery is key.

We're using lessons from agenda setting to build recovery plans. 

Stay tuned for updates on our progress.

People shared different ideas on how the state can solve community problems. Sometimes, this brought up key opportunity areas that lacked a clear path forward. We’re planning discussions (deliberation) to bring the community together. The goal is for community members to address differing opinions. We want to create action plans that everyone supports.

“Homeowners should be able to use natural gas. It's more reliable and affordable than all electric mandates.”

“All housing should be built with no gas. We are supposed to be all electric in Los Angeles by 2035...so why invest in repairing gas infrastructure that will be obsolete/stranded assets soon?”

## What’s next

We are working with public officials to plan the deliberation phase of this process. Participants will use deliberation to discuss the key opportunity areas. This can help them agree on how to move forward.

We will use the deliberations to create a series of actions that will help Los Angeles recover. 

We will post progress updates on this website.

## How we did the analysis

For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis.</a> 

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

AI was a helpful tool during our analysis, and our team checked all the findings to make sure they were relevant and accurate. We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.


**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking. 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: “First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. “Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. “Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. “Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
