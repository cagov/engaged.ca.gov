[Engaged California](https://engaged.ca.gov/) invites the public to shape the policies that impact their lives.


The platform launched in January 2025 after the Los Angeles wildfires.


The first engagement to get community feedback on disaster response began in March. Residents from Altadena, Pacific Palisades, and the greater Los Angeles area took part.


The ideas and insights we have gathered so far are invaluable.

## What we heard

We asked participants to rate the importance of 10 disaster-related topics. Participants used a 5-point scale to let us know how important it is to discuss each item further.  

This is the percentage of people who said it is very important or essential to discuss a topic further.

title: Opportunity areas

People shared different ideas on how the state can solve community problems. Sometimes, this brought up key opportunity areas that lacked a clear path forward. We’re planning discussions (deliberation) to bring the community together. The goal is for community members to address differing opinions. We want to create action plans that everyone supports.

“Homeowners should be able to use natural gas. It's more reliable and affordable than all electric mandates.”

“All housing should be built with no gas. We are supposed to be all electric in Los Angeles by 2035...so why invest in repairing gas infrastructure that will be obsolete/stranded assets soon?”

## What’s next

We are working with public officials to plan the deliberation phase of this process. Participants will use deliberation to discuss the key opportunity areas. This can help them agree on how to move forward.

We will use the deliberations to create a series of actions that will help Los Angeles recover. 

We will post progress updates on this website.

## How we did the analysis

For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis.</a> 

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

AI was a helpful tool during our analysis, and our team checked all the findings to make sure they were relevant and accurate. We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.


**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking. 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: “First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. “Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. “Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. “Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
