# LA aligns on recovery plans

In a first-of-its-kind community engagement process, more than 900 community members gathered in town halls for the digital age. Participants contributed across 2 phases to produce an action plan to recover from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. 

The action plan, developed through online deliberation sessions over a 7-month period, reflects priorities directly from those who lost homes and businesses. The priorities they set – focusing on immediate community support and long-term infrastructure improvements – will guide state and local officials toward full recovery.

## Noteworthy alignment 

People from different fire zones showed surprising consistency. Residents impacted by Eaton and Palisades ranked the top needs the same: bury power lines underground, improve water systems for firefighting, and ensure communications when there is an emergency.

This shows that regardless of geographic separation, there is community-wide agreement on essential recovery priorities.

**This group of priorities tells a clear story.**

Residents want both immediate support for recovery and long-term investments in fire-resistant infrastructure. They also need support services to be streamlined to serve the community's urgent rebuilding needs. 

This engagement allowed us to turn personal experiences into real policy guidance.

**Building on shared support**

The process didn't just gather opinions; it built confidence and momentum as we move forward together.

While participants arrived with mixed feelings—only 24% started optimistic while 48% felt pessimistic—the outlook shifted through the process. 

More than a quarter of participants (27%) emerged more optimistic about LA fires recovery.

The **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power** has filled over 80 water storage facilities to their highest level. Backup pumps are fueled and ready at each pumping station as a backup to the main pumps. They have filled their five water tenders, each with at least 4,000 gallons, and have them on standby for the **Los Angeles Fire Department** (LAFD) if needed. Four reservoirs hold billions of gallons of non-potable water for aerial firefighting.

In the Pacific Palisades area, two local reservoirs are dedicated to aerial firefighting: the Encino Reservoir and the Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir.

The **Los Angeles County Fire Department** is working with the **Los Angeles County Department of Public Works** and **6 local water companies** to assess the availability of fire flow in the fire areas. A new streamlined process will speed up the timeline. It will not require homeowners to be part of the process, and it will save them money. The **water companies**, **Los Angeles County Building and Safety**, and **LA County Fire** will handle this new process. The **fire department** will update the fire code to meet current state standards. The water companies will upgrade their systems.

The **California Public Utilities Commission** requires cell towers to have 72 hours of backup power. The rules apply to towers in zones where fire is a high threat. This kept most towers online during the January fires. **County first responders** used their FirstNet network, backed by AT&T's mobile towers. Telecommunication providers' continued investment in their infrastructure will improve emergency communication during disasters.

The **city** is coordinating a biweekly steering committee focused on emergency communication to discuss blockers and progress. The group is made up of representatives from city departments, including: 

  * **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power**  
  * **Los Angeles Department of Emergency Management** 
  * **Los Angeles Department of Planning**
  * **Los Angeles Fire Department**

This group is reviewing evacuation materials, mapping roadways, and modeling traffic evacuation routes. 

The steering committee will coordinate with stakeholders from **California State Parks**, **Los Angeles City Planning**, **Los Angeles Housing Department**, and **CalFire**.

Local officials are working to improve emergency alert and warning system effectiveness. This includes implementing recommendations from independent party reviews, including the McChrystal Group, the Fire Safety Research Institute, and the U.S. Congress.

Emergency notification systems will continue to be reviewed and improved. By focusing on making alert messages more precise and area-specific, standardizing alert language, improving multilayered notification capabilities, and enhancing coordination and training among agencies to ensure timely, clear, and geographically accurate warnings in future disasters. These improvements include outside reviews of recent wildfire alerts, increased federal funding requests, and public education efforts around opt-in notification services.

The government is stepping up to help residents, including helping to secure $3 billion in federal assistance and loans. The **state’s CalAssist Mortgage Fund** is directing over $100 million in mortgage relief. **Governor Newsom** has secured a commitment by top lenders to offer forbearance on mortgages. 

The **county** has mobilized over $50 million to support families and small businesses. This aid comes from the **LA County Wildfire Relief Fund**. The **county** has also deferred or refunded fees for zoning, plan checks, and permits. This will help homeowners reduce costs. This applies to key agencies like **Public Works**, **Regional Planning**, **Public Health**, and **Fire**. These fees can be over $20,000 per household. More support has been provided as well. Section 8 vouchers are available for displaced renters. There are emergency shelter grant funds for persons experiencing homelessness in the area. Facilitated workshops are available for seniors with reverse mortgages. 

Further, **Los Angeles Mayor** Karen Bass has issued several executive orders to streamline rebuilding and reduce costs. This includes creating the One-Stop Rebuilding Center, directing city departments to expedite building permit reviews in 30 days or less, waiving 2025 business taxes for impacted companies, directing **LA Department of Building and Safety** to pilot AI-powered pre-plan checks (Archistar eCheck AI), suspending permit and plan check fees, and launching a library of pre-approved, code-compliant designs to fast-track rebuilds. More than 4,000 residents have already been helped at the city’s One-Stop Rebuilding Center.

**Los Angeles County** is working with the state and philanthropy to launch a program to help people navigate recovery processes. Families will receive personalized help with insurance, financing, and permits. The Blueprint for Rebuilding says navigators are a major innovation in reducing barriers.

Additionally, we listened to renters when they asked us to not leave them out. The **Los Angeles County’s Fire Recovery Fund** includes direct rental assistance. **County supervisors** are reviewing stronger anti-gouging protections for tenants in fire zones.

**County**, **state**, and **philanthropy** are teaming up to provide residents with “bridge funding” to cover near-term costs to survive and begin rebuilding that are not covered by other funding sources.

Residents asked for aid without barriers during the agenda-setting phase of this engagement. **Los Angeles County** then provided language application support and direct payments through the LA Region Worker Relief Fund, including to undocumented residents. The county, with support from community groups, made sure not to exclude people. Also, the **California Department of Insurance** enforces a one-year moratorium. This means that insurers cannot cancel coverage after a declared disaster. It also requires two years of coverage for those whose homes suffered a total loss. 

The Blueprint for Rebuilding highlights the payments as a milestone in equitable recovery.

**Governor Newsom** has issued numerous executive orders waiving state permitting requirements to streamline rebuilding. The **city** and **county** created one-stop centers in areas hit by fire to support rebuilding activities. This includes Altadena and Pacific Palisades. In the **county**, One-Stop Permit Centers offer residents in-person help from various **county agencies**. In the **city**, more than 4,000 people have been helped at a One-Stop Rebuilding Center so far. County residents can apply for permits online using the EPIC-LA platform. This platform offers a unified application and review process. The goal is to make it easier to navigate. The **county** has also started its surge plan. It’s reallocating staff to meet its plan check and zoning review timelines.

### How we did the analysis

<div class="sub-head">For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis</a>.</div>

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.

**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
