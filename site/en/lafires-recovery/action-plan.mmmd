# LA aligns on recovery plans

In a first-of-its-kind community engagement process, more than 3,000 community members were invited to town halls for the digital age. Participants contributed across 2 phases to produce an action plan to recover from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. 

The action plan, developed through online deliberation sessions over a 6-month period, reflects priorities from those who were affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. The priorities they set – focusing on immediate community support and long-term infrastructure improvements – will guide state and local officials toward full recovery.

## Noteworthy alignment 

People from different fire zones showed surprising consistency. Residents impacted by Eaton and Palisades ranked the top needs the same: bury power lines underground, improve local water systems for firefighting, and ensure timely alerts when there is an emergency.


This shows that regardless of geographic separation, there is community-wide agreement on essential recovery priorities.

**This group of priorities tells a clear story.**

Residents want both immediate support for recovery and long-term investments in fire-resistant infrastructure. They also need support services to be streamlined to serve the community's urgent rebuilding needs.

This engagement allowed us to turn personal experiences into real policy guidance.

**Building on shared support**

The process didn't just gather opinions; it built confidence and momentum as we move forward together.

While participants arrived with mixed feelings—only 24% started optimistic while 48% felt pessimistic—the outlook shifted through the process. 

More than a quarter of participants (27%) emerged more optimistic about LA fires recovery.

The **county** and **state** are working with power and telecommunications companies to plan to put more utilities underground. **Governor Gavin Newsom** signed an executive order in March 2025 to fast-track this work.  

Additionally, **Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass** issued an executive order to help Palisades residents expedite rebuilding with fire-resistant materials and climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes hardening utilities for power reliability during severe weather.

Utilities are working closely with local leaders from **Los Angeles County** and the **city**. Construction is already underway in Malibu, Altadena, and Pacific Palisades. It is expected to continue for several more years. The **state** and **county** are calling for a coordinated approach to undergrounding power and telecom lines that will save money, cut down on time, and minimize disruptions from multiple work crews.

Beyond undergrounding, additional strategies are important to mitigate fire hazards, such as vegetation management and resilient rebuilding. Property owners and design/building professionals can look to the **county’s** [Resilient Rebuild Resource Guide](https://recovery.lacounty.gov/resilient-rebuilding/) for information and resources for planning, designing, and constructing a high-performance building more resilient to fire risks.

The **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power** has filled over 80 water storage facilities to their highest level. Backup pumps are fueled and ready at each pumping station as a backup to the main pumps. They have filled their five water tenders, each with at least 4,000 gallons, and have them on standby for the **Los Angeles Fire Department** (LAFD) if needed. Four reservoirs hold billions of gallons of non-potable water for aerial firefighting.

In the Pacific Palisades area, two local reservoirs are dedicated to aerial firefighting: the Encino Reservoir and the Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir.

The **Los Angeles County Fire Department** has worked with the **Los Angeles County Department of Public Works** and **7 local water companies** to assess the fire flow from the existing water systems in the fire areas. To facilitate the rebuilding process, **LA County Fire** will amend the 2026 Los Angeles County Fire Code to meet the current State Fire Code requirements. This code amendment will allow people to rebuild their homes while the water system is upgraded and improved. **LA County Fire** will continue to regularly staff and strategically place county-owned pre-positioned engines during high-fire risk periods.

Additionally, a new streamlined process has been developed that eliminates the need for homeowners to be involved in the fire flow form process. The **water companies**, **LA County Public Works**, and **LA County Fire** will handle this new process, which will streamline the timeline, eliminate the need for homeowners to complete the process, and save homeowners money.

Water districts have identified damages and applied for funding (e.g., FEMA PA) to rebuild. The **state** and **county** have committed to supporting the districts to rebuild and improve systems.

The [LA County Forward: Blueprint for Rebuilding](https://recovery.lacounty.gov/2025/08/04/los-angeles-county-accelerates-wildfire-recovery-with-bold-blueprint-to-rebuild-safer-stronger-communities/) says these upgrades are critical infrastructure investments for long-term safety.

Local officials in **Los Angeles City** and **County** have taken several concrete steps to improve how emergency alerts are issued following widespread confusion during the Eaton and Palisades fires. The **Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors** ordered an independent, external review of the emergency alert and evacuation notification systems, retaining outside experts to conduct a comprehensive after-action analysis and report back every 90 days.

The **city's Emergency Management Department** and **County Coordinated Joint Information Center** are now prioritizing enhanced training, more rigorous system tests, improved geographic targeting, clearer message wording, and stronger coordination for future life-safety emergencies.

The **city** is coordinating a biweekly steering committee focused on emergency communication to discuss blockers and progress. The group is made up of representatives from city departments, including the:  

  * **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power**  
  * **Los Angeles Department of Emergency Management** 
  * **Los Angeles Department of Planning**
  * **Los Angeles Fire Department**

County officials, in partnership with local, state, and federal partners, are working to improve emergency alert and warning system effectiveness countywide. This includes implementing recommendations from independent party reviews, including the McChrystal Group, the Fire Safety Research Institute, and the U.S. Congress.

Local emergency notification systems will continue to be reviewed and improved. By focusing on making alert messages more precise and area-specific, standardizing alert language, improving multilayered notification capabilities, and enhancing coordination and training among agencies to ensure timely, clear, and geographically accurate warnings in future disasters. These improvements include outside reviews of recent wildfire alerts, increased federal funding requests, and public education efforts around opt-in notification services.

The government has mobilized to support residents, including helping to secure $3 billion in federal assistance and loans. The **state’s CalAssist Mortgage Fund** is directing over $100 million in mortgage relief. **Governor Newsom** has secured a commitment by top lenders to offer forbearance on mortgages and signed legislation to expand forbearance to 12 months and create enforceable legal requirements. 

The **county** has mobilized over $50 million to support families and small businesses through the **LA County Wildfire Relief Fund**. To reduce permitting costs for homeowners, the **county** has also deferred or refunded specific fees for zoning, plan checks, and permits across key agencies like **Public Works**, **Regional Planning**, **Public Health**, and **Fire**. These fees can exceed $20,000 per household. The county is expediting permit plan reviews with 14-day turnaround times for initial reviews, 7-day turnaround for additional reviews, and a goal to issue the permit in 30 days. More support has been provided as well. Section 8 vouchers are available for displaced renters. There are emergency shelter grant funds for persons experiencing homelessness in the area. Workshops have been facilitated for seniors with reverse mortgages. 
 

Further, **Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass** has issued several executive orders to streamline rebuilding and reduce costs. This includes creating the One-Stop Rebuilding Center, directing city departments to expedite building permit reviews in 30 days or less, and waiving 2025 business taxes for impacted companies.

**Los Angeles County** is coordinating with the state, philanthropy, and the private sector to connect residents to services that help people navigate recovery processes, where families can receive personalized help with financing, permitting, and building to reduce barriers to recovery.

Additionally, we listened to renters when they asked us to not leave them out. The **Los Angeles County’s Fire Recovery Fund** includes direct rental assistance. **County supervisors** are reviewing stronger anti-gouging protections for tenants in fire zones.

The **county** is working to coordinate with the **state** and **philanthropy** to identify “bridge funding” for residents to cover near-term costs to survive and begin rebuilding that are not covered by other funding sources.

Residents asked for aid without barriers during the agenda-setting phase of this engagement. **Los Angeles County** then provided language application support and direct payments through the LA Region Worker Relief Fund, including to undocumented residents. The county, with support from community groups, made sure not to exclude people. Also, the **California Department of Insurance** enforces a one-year moratorium. This means that insurers cannot cancel coverage after a declared disaster. It also requires two years of coverage for those whose homes suffered a total loss. 

The Blueprint for Rebuilding highlights the payments as a milestone in equitable recovery.

**Governor Newsom** has issued numerous executive orders waiving state permitting requirements to streamline rebuilding. The **city** and **county** created one-stop centers in areas hit by fire to support rebuilding activities. This includes Altadena, Calabasas, and Pacific Palisades.

In the **county**, the Calabasas and Altadena One-Stop Permit Centers offer residents in-person help from various county agencies, where more than 8,500 residents have been helped so far. In the city, more than 4,000 people have been helped at a One-Stop Rebuilding Center so far. County residents can apply for permits online using the EPIC-LA platform, which offers a unified application and review process to simplify navigation. The **county** is working quickly to meet growing permit demand by reallocating staff and bringing on additional contract workers as needed, as well as rolling out the AI eCheck pilot with Archistar. The county also offers a [pre-approved plan catalog](https://recovery.lacounty.gov/rebuilding/preapproved-plans/) with designs that are in compliance with current zoning and building code requirements. Pre-approved plans and streamlined permitting processes can help homeowners rebuild more efficiently, safely, and affordably.

In a parallel effort, **Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass** has issued executive orders directing **LA Department of Building and Safety** to pilot AI-powered pre-plan checks (Archistar eCheck AI), suspending permit and plan check fees, and launching a library of pre-approved, code-compliant designs to fast-track rebuilds in the city. More than 4,000 city residents have already been helped at the city’s One-Stop Rebuilding Center.

The **county** is accelerating the permitting and inspection processes through “fast-tracks”, which are streamlined lanes to expedite rebuilding while maintaining safety and code compliance. This includes expanding the pre-approved plan catalog and bundling reviews for similar projects.

The **county** is also increasing surge capacity by expanding the AI eCheck pilot with Archistar, growing digital and remote inspections, and adding plan checkers and inspectors to handle higher volumes.

### How we did the analysis

<div class="sub-head">For a deeper look, <a href="/lafires-recovery/agenda-setting-data-insights/">check out our detailed methodology and comments analysis</a>.</div>

We used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet generative AI model to help find themes and trends in the comments. We prompted the model with questions to help us understand what people thought. This was an efficient way to see how people agreed or disagreed on important topics. 

We tested different ways to write the prompts. We focused on the answers that came up often, regardless of how we asked the questions.

**Sample prompts**

“I would like you to analyze a set of qualitative survey responses using extended thinking.” 

“Start by doing an initial exploration of the data: First, read through the entire dataset without categorizing or labeling. Note your immediate observations and impressions about what stands out to you. Identify recurring words, phrases, and sentiments that appear across multiple responses. Share what surprised you or caught your attention in this initial review.”
