# Accessibility

This website was authored by the Office of Data and Innovation.

The Office of Data and Innovation (ODI) is committed to providing digital accessibility to everyone. ODI aims to make this website accessible to users with sensory, cognitive, and mobility disabilities. And ultimately to all users, regardless of ability. We consistently look for ways to make our website more accessible. 

ODI’s website meets or exceeds the requirements of:

* The World Wide Web Consortium Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, Level AA,
* The California Unruh Civil Rights Act, and
* The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

ODI uses [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/)'s accessibility audit to check our pages. You can view  accessibility scores on each page. We also use [@axe-core/puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/puppeteer) to check accessibility during our publishing process. ODI manually tests each page using accessibility tools like screen readers. This helps us find problems automated tools don’t catch.

We also consider performance a part of accessibility. Websites that load fast on all devices better serve Californians.

You can learn more about our philosophies around [performance, accessibility, and readability](https://innovation.ca.gov/page-score-info/).

We want to hear from you if you encounter any accessibility barriers on this website. We also welcome you to reach out if you have suggestions on how we can make this website more accessible. You can contact us at [info@innovation.ca.gov](mailto:info@innovation.ca.gov).
