The State of California is bringing survivors and those impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires together to engage,
interact, and share ideas. These insights will help shape recovery plans and collectively design wildfire recovery
policy. Engaged California expands California's all-in response to the wildfires. This platform allows state and local
officials to hear and understand the needs of the people who survived the devastating fires.

## Overview

The Engaged California team will work with community members from greater Los Angeles. We will focus on people from
Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Your journey with Engaged California begins with discussions to navigate difficult and
complex topics. You will work through differences in opinion about how to recover from the fires. At the end of this
road, we'll have identified the issues that are the most important to recovery.

### About the process

Engaged California is built upon deliberative democracy. It's unlike polling, voting, or town halls. Deliberative
democracy empowers you to engage with your government in a new way. Engaged California is a space for you to have
meaningful dialogue with others. This deepens understanding and can guide policy choicesâ€”before the choices are made.

The Engaged California team will carefully set the stage for effective deliberation. We'll work with our partners to set up deliberations that lead to actionable and relevant next steps.

We'll use the takeaways from agenda setting to find the right policymakers and officials to work with. We'll also carefully plan a deliberation opportunity for each of the wildfire recovery efforts we're focusing on in this engagement: Eaton and Palisades.

This might take a while. The work requires a lot of detail and care to ensure we enable deliberations that lead to actionable and relevant next steps.

title: Deliberation
----

You will discuss what the community needs most. You'll reach a consensus on how to ensure a speedy and equitable recovery. We don't expect this to be easy. Some topics might be triggering. But reaching consensus lets you inform what actions state or local officials take on fire recovery.

id: phase6
title: Reporting
----

We will review and analyze the outcomes of the deliberation phase. We'll work with government officials to find actions that respond to the deliberation. We will post a report of findings and actions on this website.
