## Overview

The Engaged California team will work with community members from greater Los Angeles. We will focus on people from
Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Your journey with Engaged California begins with discussions to navigate difficult and
complex topics. You will work through differences in opinion about how to recover from the fires. At the end of this
road, we'll have identified the issues that are the most important to recovery.
