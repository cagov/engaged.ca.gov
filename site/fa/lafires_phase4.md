The Engaged California team will carefully set the stage for effective deliberation. We'll work with our partners to set up deliberations that lead to actionable and relevant next steps.

We'll use the takeaways from agenda setting to find the right policymakers and officials to work with. We'll also carefully plan a deliberation opportunity for each of the wildfire recovery efforts we're focusing on in this engagement: Eaton and Palisades.

This might take a while. The work requires a lot of detail and care to ensure we enable deliberations that lead to actionable and relevant next steps.
