1590,Emergency planning & community safety,The Palisades community had been asking about evacuation routes for many years and none was made clear. We are all very fortunate that Palisades High was not in session on the day of the fire as the City had issues evacuating the number of people in the Palisades without having 1000s of students also in session. There seemed to be a lack of coordination with traffic control once evacuation orders were given leading to residents abandoning their cars on Sunset. What and how traffic control plans will look like in future evacuations is a significant question.,Density v. Safety,"Lack of clear evacuation routes caused chaos during the fire.

Every home at the perimeter should have subsidized water and retardant systems, detectors and a wide boundary around these residential areas should have thorough brush clearance (Goats, sheep, fairly paid incarcerated) to inhibit the spread of fire from starting conflagration - where hot burning homes ignite homes from high infrared, not even sparks needed.
