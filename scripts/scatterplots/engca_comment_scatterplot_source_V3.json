This means that people with fewer financial resources (including seniors) are forced to wait until the very last minute to leave--putting themselves in great danger and making the situation more difficult and dangerous for first responders, as well. And because lodging coverage stops as soon as evac orders are lifted, people here were forced to return to unsafe situations, with no running water, no power and no internet (at a time when kids were still doing remote learning due to COVID). The state needs to be aware of this issue and work with insurance providers to resolve it.",
