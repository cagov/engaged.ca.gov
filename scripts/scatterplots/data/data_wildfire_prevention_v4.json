It is quite unreasonable and irresponsible that more than half of our budget goes to the police and lawsuits to settle their brutality. Adding insult to injury, it is malpractice that L.A. city has not yet cancelled the Olympics in 2028 given we have a $1 Billion deficit in our budget. Accountability begins by looking objectively at the situation we are in, not at the situation you hope we were in or trying hard to please corporate campaign donors.",

It takes some strong political will along with a growth plan (with growth limits) to say that some areas, like repeated burn communities, are off limits to development.",
