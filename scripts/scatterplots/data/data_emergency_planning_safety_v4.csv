555,Emergency planning & community safety,Emergency warning systems,"In Japan they have an extremely loud warning system for tsunamis and evacuation routes well marked

I believe we still have the vestiges of an old air raid siren system here
In the 1970's they used to test it about once a month if I recall correctly

Coordination among agencies is of paramount importance in disaster reaction & recovery
We have more than enough Fed & State human, financial & material resources 2 face the challenges

Unfortunately they are poorly coordinated  It is good that Gov Newsome designated a PPP 2 manage the recovery, this should work well

The well known people & companies involved in LA Rises & Steadfast LA are much appreciated, however PPPs need to include people with a vision for sustainable community development",7.421389103,7.895020008

Education programs regarding the many resources that exist and are free that enable residents to know what's going on around them. The Genasys Protect app was mentioned in county notifications. Anyone with a phone could have downloaded it and been on top of developments and information streams from multiple sources. But you wouldn't know that if you didn't follow the link. Improving the systems has a lot to do with empowering each person, making them aware of how much information is in the public sphere and making sure they know how to access it, including having the necessary device(s).

1291,Emergency planning & community safety,Emergency warning systems,"In our rural area, we've discovered the hard way that key equipment for landlines, cable/internet and cell service often shares a power pole. Which means literally every means of communication most people have access to goes down at the same time if the fire takes out that ONE pole. There ought to be a mandate for undergrounding ALL of those services and separating them where undergrounding is not possible. A grant program to equip rural residents with satellite phones for emergency use would also help, as would establishing local emergency radio frequencies we could tune into for updates. Also, cell phones should be able to connect to ANY available tower for ALL CALLS (not just 911) and alerts (nixle, watch duty, etc) during emergencies.",8.155919075,6.493556499

I think the city did a good job alerting people to high fire risk prior to the windstorm, as long as residents were signed up for the city's NotifyLA system and looked at NOAA reports ahead of time.  I don't know how best to get alerts to all citizens, especially the elderly who may be technology averse.

313,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,we 100% need a better plan and to practice emergency evacuation in the palisades. the fact that people had to abandon their cars or go BACK to their houses in harms way can and will lead to more deaths if this ever happens again. creating more fire roads and also having a plan to get emergency vehicles in from different route would help.,2.162431479,3.345978737

There are no evacuation routes for our canyon areas. LAFD has told us they will assess the situation at the time.

1292,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,"Regarding evac routes: like Paradise, CA, my town has only one road that leads into and out of the area. It's a narrow, winding two-lane road, making evacuation slow. It's essential that people be able to leave well before evacuation becomes mandatory (see my earlier note about temporary housing coverage gaps), so that we aren't all trying to navigate that route at the same time under duress. 

There are two other potential evac routes--an unpaved route through a State Forest and a paved road that's half collapsed due to erosion. Both are currently impassable and essentially death traps, but they could be turned into functional evacuation routes if funds were made available. I'm sure similar opportunities exist in other communities.",3.676577091,3.273530245

1385,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,"This has to become the rule in neighborhoods, block clubs, community organizations and cities in the County.  Citizens need to be prepared, informed, and ready to handle whatever comes their way in an emergency, assuming that no one is coming to save them.  We need to have EMT/CPR skills on our blocks, have a communication system that is analog in the case of no communication, and a way to account for and support each other in scenarios where city and county services are over-taxed and not able to provide the level of support needed.

My nephew didn't even react the other day when we had a 4.5 earthquake. He didn't even acknowledge it. We need to prepare children from a young age. All cities should look at Laguna Beach, they offer free or $50 first aid/earthquake kits. All Middle and HS should require students take CERT classes.

It would be beneficial to the community to conduct annual drills, training, and more outreach to educate those prone to wildfire. For example, I'm not sure everyone knows about FEMA's Incident Command System or what CalOES does; but they should. Especially if they live and work in areas prone to wildfire.

1555,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,"I think all of these systems need to be reviewed from the bottom up and out as well as from the top down. Creating voluntary neighbourhood emergency councils, coordinated and supported by agencies and city councils can create a resilient community ecosystem for responding to disaster in the longer term. Evacuation routes are problematic in this area: it took us 2 hours to travel a distance that normally takes 15 minutes when evacuating and that was actually on us for leaving it until the last minute to evacuate.

1590,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,The Palisades community had been asking about evacuation routes for many years and none was made clear. We are all very fortunate that Palisades High was not in session on the day of the fire as the City had issues evacuating the number of people in the Palisades without having 1000s of students also in session. There seemed to be a lack of coordination with traffic control once evacuation orders were given leading to residents abandoning their cars on Sunset. What and how traffic control plans will look like in future evacuations is a significant question.,2.742370129,3.420547724
1652,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,"In the absence of available personnel to direct traffic, there must be some technology in this day and age to serve that function through programming of the traffic lights.

1684,Emergency planning & community safety,Evacuation planning,"I agree. When the light on Sunset and Bienveneda went out, it made it really challenging to evacuate the school, with parents braving the busy intersection on foot to direct traffic.

And clearly, there was not a well rehearsed protocol for what to do in a major fire storm. All of this is inexcusable.

Today technology allows for alerts to be given so people can leave an area before the danger arrives, not flee their possessions and elderly or inform as fires encroaches on their own life. 

Going forward, the State of CA should implement a disaster protocol set and incentivize cities to train and follow it when those towns are located in obviously risky fire or earthquake zones.",3.707924604,7.8974967

There was no electronic evacuation warning, cell service, or reverse 911 call in this area, as there were in La Crescenta when the Station Fire was advancing overnight into the neighborhoods.
