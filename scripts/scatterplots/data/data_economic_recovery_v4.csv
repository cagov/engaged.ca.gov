684,Economic recovery & small business support,Employment opportunities,"The entertainment industry, along with a lot of Los Angeles, has lost jobs over the past five years. We should focus on returning these individuals to work in our community whenever possible. While I get we have an outside contractor with expertise in this area, why don't we require them to hire people who have lived in LA for an extended period?
