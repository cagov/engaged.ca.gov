I know some homeowners will struggle because they want to rebuild THE house, but many of those houses had outdated materials that are no longer up to code. But helping people see how they can rebuild with the proper materials will get some people over that hump quickly. Additionally, ADUs are a great way to help people earn extra income to cover their mortgages/insurance -- or to bring loved ones in when they need housing. This should be something that can be fast-tracked immediately.
