532,Emotional & mental health support,Other,"If we put ourselves in the shoes of someone who has lost their home it is easy to see how anyone could use some emotional support.

559,Emotional & mental health support,Other,Support that can be utilized online and that is not connected to church organizations feels incredibly necessary.

585,Emotional & mental health support,Other,I think we overemphasized mental health in the early weeks of the disaster.  There was so much offered in terms of mental support and counseling but people had no where to sleep and no where to eat. They did not have time to sit in a circle and talk about their mental state.  We were all in shock!  We were all under pressure!  None of us were doing well. Everyone was breaking down. What is needed is a community response to meet basic needs with a caring attitude.
