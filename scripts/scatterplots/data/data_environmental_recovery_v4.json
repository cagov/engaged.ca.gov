I understand the sense of urgency to clear, and be seen to be acting to clear, immediate fire sites but displacing such toxicity onto adjacent areas without consultation has seriously injured community relations. When people go to court, you know the human system has broken. The issue is much bigger than LA - how are other disaster areas dealing with toxic waste. What lessons can we learn from elsewhere. What lessons are we learning and need to share ourselves?",
