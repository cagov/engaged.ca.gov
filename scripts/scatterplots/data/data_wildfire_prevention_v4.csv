1716,Wildfire prevention prioritization & accountability,Controlled burns and firebreaks,"Fire prevetion programs and predicting where firebreaks will be best utilized is important. I think our government is learning from this experience, and funds would best be spent on studies and programs to address wildfire risks in a future with rapid climate change.
