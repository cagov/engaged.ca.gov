1357,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,"This is critical, of course, but many of us have already done this for a long time. Topanga has been a Firewise community since 2021, and we also have a very active Arson Watch, Firesafe Council, CERT, and Emergency Preparedness group in our midst. So, for us-this action isn't a ""recovery priority"" so much as it is [already] a way of life. 
*The only additional items I would request for our community would be to install a buried/retractable high-powered sprinkler system around the entire perimeter of our community and/or where it comes into contact with open space/the wildland urban interface (WUI). This system could be hooked up to non-potable water tanks (that are filled with captured stormwater) and ""powered"" with solar.",41.23438644,24.68694687
1650,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,Train community groups like town/neighborhood councils and CERTs on defensible space/structure hardening and have them conduct community-wide property reviews and education. Does not have to be an enforcement or narc approach but rather an offering of information specific to the property; it can even be a checklist on a trifold that checks off items that need to be retrofitted and specific instructions for the retrofit inside. It takes a village to educate but there's heavy reliance on the few in the government.,41.63787842,22.77032661
1636,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,All lots need to be cleared bc it cannot really be cleaned up if toxic material is airborne. There should be a city wide emergency day that educates people on safety and evacuations (Japan does this for earthquakes). It can be led by the city w/localities doing their own area-specific drills.,38.45637512,24.34539223

624,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,"There was a sore lack of preparedness training and we need more resources for that. For example, Pasadena only held a handful of CERT trainings in 2024 - after several year hiatus. They have not had any scheduled since at least fall of 2024. The public emergency preparedness also needs to cover wildfire (and fires in general). I did training, including map my neighborhood before the pandemic and my training and to-go-bag were mostly irrelevant because it was mostly for earthquake disaster. The only design education the public gets is about drought-tolerant/resistance. There needs to be more education on fire-resistant design and mitigation measures. Just like there are tax credits for turf removal, there should be incentives for wildfire.",41.31085968,22.32668686
873,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,"We need a better emergency system. California currently does not have any emergency preparedness system. The L.A. County digital broadcast was a joke - either going off every hour or being sent out to areas not even effected. After the third false alarm, you start to believe the government is playing wolf. How was this allowed? How is it the areas of Tornado Alley in the country have loud emergency systems, yet we do not? We need that as well. What if people don't have a smartphone? How will they ever be notified? WE NEED A BETTER WAY.",40.95052338,21.47303009
890,Climate & community resilience,Community preparedness,"Funding for communities to engage organizers and facilitators to act as paid (not volunteer, as is the Topanga Town Council, Chamber of Commerce, Emergency Preparedness (TCEP), elderly support (SAGES) - to bring community leaders together, to interface with govt agencies.
There should be a team specifically dedicated to coordination and communications as soon as a fire or other crisis strikes.

1218,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,Need community coordination of these efforts and either make it mandatory (part of building code) or offer financial incentives to harden homes against fire. Loosen some aspects of code/standards that are preventing us from staggering homes on lots to reduce structure-to-structure fire risk.,44.29405975,24.7529335
1572,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,"Change can be difficult.  I, too, love to have plants near and around my home, but if the reality of fire risk is there...it would be selfish to refuse.  The same applies to building materials.  While I would once have scoffed at the idea of stucco siding, I now look at this as potentially a safer alternative to all wood siding.  That may or may not be true, but if I were building from scratch, I would embrace all I could learn about fire resistant design, just as I look at accessible design needs.",41.72094727,25.38347244
758,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,"We all know what we would prefer our communities ""look"" like, but recognizing the hazards of where we live and HOW we need to build in preparation for those hazards is more important than our cultural ideal of a neighborhood.

370,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,"These initiatives should be incentivized to encourage participation, and the public should be educated about their benefits and importance. However, making them mandatory may not be the best approach, as it could lead to resistance or unintended consequences. Instead, fostering voluntary engagement through positive reinforcement would likely yield better long-term outcomes.",43.66854858,25.58532524
379,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,"All new construction should be fire-resistant.

541,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,"Promoting the PACE-Property Assessed Clean Energy program and  encouraging residents to rebuild with solar roof tiles would be helpful These materials are more fire resistant & widespread deployment would reduce the strain on the grid

If not solar tiles, other roofing materials that are inherently fire resistant and manufactured using a circular process should be used

LA Rises or another PPP should be assigned the task of bundling the orders  for the materials  They could acquire them @ wholesale prices & distribute them @ cost

PACE could lower costs by using blended finance vehicles incorporating grant $ & concessionary capital to fund projects

These discounts along with fed/state incentives & grants would significantly reduce cost",43.60757065,25.72333145
640,Climate & community resilience,Fire resistant building and landscaping,It is important to consider fire-resistant designs when rebuilding but I think it also needs to be acknowledged that most of the parts of Altadena that burned are not generally considered fire prone. The edges of Altadena that abut wild land are areas with a higher risk but the fire that burned throughout Altadena reached areas that were and are not forested.

Frankly, I was surprised and dismayed that there aren't any future rebuilding requirements to use fire-resistant technologies or building materials or landscaping.
