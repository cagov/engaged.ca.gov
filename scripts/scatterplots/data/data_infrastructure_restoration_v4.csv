293,Infrastructure & utilities restoration,Climate resilient infrastructure ,"Our utilities keep causing these devastating fires and they are getting worse with climate change. We need to fix our utilities to prevent these fires from starting again, clear hazard brush while maintaining wild lands and native plants, create mandatory setbacks, remove palm trees and begin to prepare for the reality we now face. We need roof top sprinklers and water agencies with infrastructure with redundancies that can accommodate extreme use in wildfire events. We need water and power to adapt to climate change and build infrastructure that shuts down without starting fires and keeps water running during fires.

Why?  A key point of emphasis for a well designed and implemented ""renewal engine"" is always the concept of integration.  In this context, the issue is less one of whether each of these themes is worthy, important and/or even essential, and much more how the integration of their implementation serves the vision which is the sine qua non of a true ""renewal engine"".
