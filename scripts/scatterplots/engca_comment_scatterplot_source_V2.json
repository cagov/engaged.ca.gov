The same applies to building materials.  While I would once have scoffed at the idea of stucco siding, I now look at this as potentially a safer alternative to all wood siding.  That may or may not be true, but if I were building from scratch, I would embrace all I could learn about fire resistant design, just as I look at accessible design needs.",
