Governmental agencies let the city of LA develop and sprawl into high fire-risk areas. Insurance companies, like when people build beachfront homes in hurricane country, jacked up the insurance rates. When an insurance company says an area is dangerous, believe them.

Forcing other taxpayers to supplement a ""wood home in a tinderbox"" is ludicrous. Saying it's the homeowners' fault for having a home in a tinderbox is likewise insane; they aren't fire experts.
