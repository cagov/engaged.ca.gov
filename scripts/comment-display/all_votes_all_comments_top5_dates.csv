With the new fire maps, my main north/south escape route is now going through a very high severity fire zone which is completely lined with old power lines on both sides of the street. Having seen the massive amount of downed lines during the fire and now knowing that they were indeed live and in many cases blocked the roads, I feel constantly worried about being blocked in by downed lines or poles when trying to evacuate and concerned that we will have to flee on foot. The power pole outside my house leans at a 75deg angle. Also really tall palm trees are a surprisingly bad wind/fire hazard.",0,0,0,2025-07-29 16:09:15.000 Z
