But that didn't help at all when the fire was drawing close to our house. The wind presumably prevented any fire fighting action for our entire neighborhood. We lost 25% of the houses and no fire fighters came to fight the fires. So monitoring the fire with a lot of extra personnel might not be the best use of resources. More fire fighting equipment and better water management might be more useful.,0,0

Ask CalFire and the other Fire agencies what would actually help them and then do that. They know what is practical and useful and more than likely they have been asking for it for a decade.

Two major water sources were empty prior to the fire for maintenance.   It was ridiculous doing repairs to reservoirs during the height of fire season. Those repairs should have been done in the winter when fire risk was significantly reduced. Our house was destroyed in Malibu as a direct result of the fire department not being able to extinguishing the palisades fire prior to it reaching Malibu. Poor water management and not utilizing the fire departments resources was a much to blame as the high winds for the destruction of Malibu homes and businesses after the fire wasn't controlled in palisades.,0,0
