There is nothing more frustrating than being a law-abiding taxpayer, and watching people take advantage of the system and steal more in tax revenue in one year then I will likely earn in my lifetime.  People just start new corporations or other entities and ultimately have no personal responsibility after not paying any taxes for several years.  The system is way too easy to take advantage of and it very demoralizing to watch it be abused decade after decade and all they would have to do is make it easier to go after known cheaters and remove some of the protections corporations or other entities have and hold the owners responsible for cheating.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-25T17:22:48+0000,0,"[

One example involved streamlining the internal administrative operations. The original workflow had multiple redundant review layers, causing delays of up to 30 days. Using process mapping and stakeholder interviews, we identified non-value-added steps and consolidated approvals, cutting the turnaround time by 40%.

In another case, I led a Kaizen event to improve customer response times in public requests for service. By analyzing call center data and applying root cause analysis, we restructured the triage process and introduced a simple decision tree for frontline staff. This reduced call escalations by 25% and improved first-contact resolution.

These projects not only improved service delivery but also empowered staff by giving them tools to identify and solve problems on their own.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-08-29T18:40:00+0000,0,"[

5194,,8aa73389-08e1-47bd-bb2f-3964a8e5081d,"One of the most enlightening books I've read recently was 'Poverty, by America' by Matthew Desmond. In it, he points out how, while well-intentioned, so many government programs are not being used by those who need the benefits most because they are too difficult to navigate or confusing for people to use. This creates an impression among low-income folks that state government is AGAINST them, not for them. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of distrust between the very people who would most benefit from our services. 

We need (not in order):
1. Data: Identify unused gov't services
2. Tech: Provide a unified, easy to remember, accessible access point to connect people with services
3. Reform: Review all public benefits we provide in California from a modern, poverty reduction point of view, at every level, and flag those services that may need legislative reform so we can make recommendations to legislature. 
4. Project management: Task force to address poverty (different than homelessness, and not meant to replace current efforts there) in California.
5. Marketing: Make combating poverty our primary focus, drill it into every state department at every level looking for ways to address, including inter-agency efforts and private sector-style promo to draw people in. Almost like a rebrand.

This would be a huge lift but when we have so many services, so many people struggling, plus such a negative impression of gov't, it seems like it would be a win-win-win for everyone.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-29T20:57:25+0000,0,"[

I was asked in a survey about improvements that we can recommend and I mentioned about that way we put a price on a project (estimate).  The following year it was a requirement for us to show how we came up with the Estimated Cost to do the project- Breaking down all the work and cost.

Someone created a database of cost and we started using that database without much thought and my opinion it became worse in coming out with estimating the cost of a project.  The project cost is inflated 60 percent more to make sure we have enough money for the project-  meaning still do not know what we are doing.

If someone comes to my house and give me an estimated cost to place a lighting pole, trench 100 feet, dig a foundation, add a breaker.  Do you think that I can get a quick estimate by going to lows, Home Depot? Yes!

State estimate Cost $65,000

The desired outcome: less traffic and congestion, fewer auto accidents, and reduced emissions.

I know for example it would save quite a bit money and Staff hours in DHCS, a seemingly unrelated Department, if we can reduce the number of auto accidents occurring in CA.  It's also known that the majority of DHCS funding goes to paying for medical services, so any opportunity to reduce serious injury will also provide state savings.

Beyond that, better public transit can reduce costs of living for Californians, promote better public health outcomes, aid CalEPA's mission, and hopefully in the long term also make Caltrans' job easier, with hopefully less travel infrastructure needing maintenance.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T00:13:49+0000,0,"[

I know when I wanted to apply to be a state working nobody wanted to tell me how the process is done. Now that I been working 4 years in the department, I noticed that across the board hiring and retaining workers is a challenge. For the interview process if people don't show up, they are unable to go lower in the tier to hire candidates that didn't score high but are willing to work. Also people go out on injury for months at a time leaving areas understaffed. They are unable to put a temporary person or hire a new person while that person is on leave. This leaves the rest of the team overworked and unhappy to be doing several people's job. Also moving up we have meetings 1 a year about moving up but they make no effort to communicate with the people interested in moving up. I had communicated several times, and it seems they are always on vacation. I think upwards mobility is a myth. Also when issue's arrive with payroll leading to Sacramento someone is always on vacation. The next person in line usually does not want to be bothered and will not cover their shift unless absolutely necessary. I feel like there needs to be oversight and accountability.

Low morale is caused by at least two things: 1) not listening or respecting state workers; 2) bad management/unfair division of labor.  When policies are implemented that do not effectively consider the potential impacts on the lives of civil servants, such as RTO--state workers will lose all drive to do good work.  Why work hard for a system that does not care about you and won't listen to you?  Poor leadership has the same effect.  Managers can get stuck in their ways and refuse to rethink processes or challenge other policies/processes that are clearly inefficient--even when their employees are expressing the need for change.  When employees are able to live and work comfortably (by being paid a fair wage, have a good work-life balance, be able to work in safe environments, like their homes, free from distracting co-workers and racist/sexist/inappropriate conduct), and when they see their management step up and be good leaders (by listening, pivoting when needed), that is what will improve efficiency!",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T18:00:44+0000,1,"[

What about charging for delays? If a contract for construction takes longer than originally planned (by the bidder) then they are charged per day/week/month extra.

The department depends on accurate, timely data to manage California’s water, yet many workflows remain manual, siloed, and slow. For example, the current processes for generating critical data—like ETaw used in water budget calculations—span multiple teams, take up to 12 weeks, and involve redundant steps such as manual file transfers, duplicated analysis, and outdated tools. These inefficiencies limit transparency, slow responses to urgent requests, and create inconsistencies across programs.

I proposse Land and Water Use Cloud Pilot aims to address these bottlenecks by demonstrating how a modern, cloud-based data stack can streamline workflows. By automating repetitive tasks, integrating land use and water use analyses, and leveraging scalable platforms such as Google Earth Engine and Snowflake, the pilot will reduce turnaround times, improve collaboration, and ensure results are both accurate and transparent.

This proof-of-concept will show how moving from fragmented, manual systems to an integrated cloud environment can cut processing times dramatically (e.g., reducing ETaw delivery from 12 weeks to 4), while laying the foundation for broader adoption of modern solutions across DWR. Ultimately, this approach strengthens our ability to conserve water, respond quickly to partners, and deliver high-value information to millions of Californians",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-19T18:23:52+0000,0,"[

Even without considering working conditions or what's best for the state employee (although I think telework supports those, too), utilizing telework dramatically reduces overhead costs with no negative impact to work product. Many departments reported improved efficiency during the pandemic with 100% (or near 100%) telework. Telework also improves recruiting, as departments aren't limited to candidates local to Sacramento and can effectively and efficiently hire from across the state. With finances growing tighter and tighter every year, telework is an easy way to address budget shortfalls in a way that unions and employees will also support (as opposed to layoffs and furloughs). I could talk about management inefficiencies, obtuse procedures, and other issues all day long, but this inefficient use of taxpayer dollars is the problem which has the most obvious and straightforward solution that will have the most significant immediate impact.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T16:00:04+0000,3,"[

Expanding digital tools so routine transactions (like licensing, claims, or payments) can be handled online without delays.
Building a culture of accountability and care inside state service when employees feel supported and trusted, they can serve the public more effectively.
Additional Idea – Psychological Safety
One area that could make a major difference is strengthening psychological safety in the workplace. From my own challenges, I have seen how difficult it is when employees don’t feel safe speaking up about concerns. On the other hand, when supervisors and leaders model openness and there is a strong support system in place, employees feel empowered to raise issues early, collaborate more effectively, and focus on delivering excellent service.
Investing in training and systems that reinforce psychological safety would not only protect employee well-being but also improve performance and service to Californians.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-25T19:46:49+0000,0,"[

And the staff of these managers have no voice. This causes both the management and teams members to stagnate and lose sight of serving the public; eventually many work environments become stressful and toxic.  

My idea is to one: give the voice to the team members as this forum does, but allow them to rate their managers or supervisors yearly. Two: measure the amount of turnover on a yearly basis under the tenure of a manager or supervisor. Managers, could be put on yearly training assignments where they can serve in different state organizations. Based on the metrics after 2 or 3 years use the metrics to determine if a manager is effective. If a manager doesn't prove to be effective after this tenure they should be released, re-assigned or demoted. If they are measured to be effective, can they can then be assigned to a permanent position but can be re-evaluated after another 3 years.

This is the basis of my idea. Currently, when a person occupies a managerial seat, there is very little to prevent them from becoming a bottle-neck to progress and there's nothing the team can do about this. I've seen millions of tax payers dollars go to waste because of this scenario. I have seen many managers who are micro-manage out of fear and ignorance and the staff is at their mercy which is a moral killer.

Too much emphasis is placed on rigid rules about where employees sit, how many minutes their breaks are, and other political battles, instead of focusing on improving programs and actually saving money. For example, cutting back on telework only forces more cars onto the road, increases congestion, adds to air pollution, and wastes time and money on commuting and parking. It lowers employee satisfaction and productivity. A better solution is to invest in flexible, results-oriented work structures. Telework should be preserved and expanded where possible, with clear performance metrics and accountability built around outcomes rather than physical presence. This reduces costs tied to office space and commuting while allowing employees to devote more energy to meaningful work that directly benefits Californians.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-30T16:44:46+0000,0,"[

Many working families face food insecurity or risk of homelessness because their income technically disqualifies them from aid, yet their wages are not enough to meet California’s high cost of living.
To solve this, I would propose expanding tiered or “bridge” programs that provide partial assistance on a sliding scale rather than an all-or-nothing cutoff. For example, a working family over the income limit for SNAP could still receive reduced benefits to help offset grocery costs, while rental support could offer temporary subsidies based on local housing markets. Additionally, strengthening public-private partnerships with nonprofits, food banks, and community organizations would stretch resources further.
By reimagining assistance as a continuum of support, rather than a strict threshold, we can help stabilize California’s working community and reduce the cycle of crisis many families face despite being employed.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-29T21:56:04+0000,0,"[

At the district where I work, we have been chronically understaffed for as long as I've worked here and long before I started. Presently, we are short two supervisory managers that are needed to help direct key program areas and many full time positions in our district remain unfilled. At the same time, we are told that we need to provide the same, if not higher level of service to the public. This leads to existing staff being worn beyond thin working multiple jobs and duty statements that do not accurately reflect their workload. The situation just feels like a crash happening in slow motion with me as a rank-and-file watching it happen with little that I can do about it.

If I had a magic wand that could easily change things, I would focus on ramping up hiring and retention. I understand there are budgetary considerations, but it is not possible to recruit and retain long term employees if our district does not have any growth opportunities for seasonal staffing. An overreliance on seasonal employees seems to be the crutch that my department relies on, forcing interested seasonals to endure years of attrition and competition before landing a permanent position.

By retaining more long term employees, they will have a better chance of learning how state systems work and managing them efficiently and effectively.

I also feel that during the mapping process with the Organizational Improvement Office, OIO, best practices should be shared with all department employees as they are working through their mapping and not at the very end once they have mapped all of the processes for the entire division. This would allow for immediate changes and streamlining to occur, instead of waiting for two years or more for the mapping to be completed before the results are released to the department. Change and innovate as we go, share the knowledge and best practices as soon as it is identified so employees can save valuable time and State money.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T16:30:09+0000,0,"[

Once a position is upgraded, it is very difficult to get it downgraded again when the person moves on, because there is a general perception that more money = better staff. This is not the case. I have seen staff in very handsomely paid positions doing the work of an AGPA. It is also devastating from a succession planning standpoint, because everything becomes so high level that there are no entry level positions to feed the higher-level vacancies. As a result, all new hires are new to the department, and no institutional knowledge is maintained as the more senior folks leave for even further promotions.

Not to mention that the more positions are upgraded inappropriately, the more expensive it is to support. This cuts into programmatic funding meant for carrying out the mission of the department.

Currently, employees are reviewed by supervisors, but managers rarely receive input from the staff and programs they oversee. This creates a blind spot: how can managers become better leaders, improve efficiency, and address challenges if they never hear from the people most affected by their decisions?

Once someone becomes a manager, the department’s instinct is often to protect them from criticism. While meant to support leadership, this practice can unintentionally foster waste, fraud, abuse, and inefficiencies. Without meaningful feedback, even well-intentioned managers may not know what needs to change.

A balanced system would introduce safe, constructive ways for staff to share input—such as anonymous surveys or 360-degree reviews—while preserving fairness and professionalism. The goal is not blame, but growth: identifying strengths, addressing weaknesses, and building stronger teams. This feedback loop would improve trust, strengthen programs, and ensure managers are as accountable as the staff they supervise.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-19T18:27:55+0000,0,"[

Many would even out if given a stable place to live. The ""bootstraps"" mentality doesn't work when there aren't any boots. Also, what's better, people languishing on the streets in front of our tourist attractions, or the streets being clean because people are housed? 

FAQ: Why can’t they work?
- Many do but don't make enough for rent
- Many are disabled & can't work fulltime/at all. SSI is not enough to cover housing. Many are veterans who lost housing. Section 8 list is years long
- Many are elderly. Some are formerly “normal” people who lost everything in 2008 before they were going to retire & never recovered
- Some have criminal records which hinders hiring
- Job market is bad right now

FAQ: Why can't they just go to shelters? 
- Shelters break families up bc many are separated by gender, so some families prefer to stay together in their cars or on the street
- Curfews. Need to be in by 8 pm and out by 6 am, which is hard for working people
- Easy place to get your stuff stolen
- Not always accommodating for disabled people

FAQ: Why are they on drugs/alcohol?
- Some are actually not, they have MH disorders that can look like usage
- Some use uppers to stay awake because of theft, assault, etc
- Some just like to use, but we shouldn't not help bc of this.

If talented staff can telework full time with better work life balance and greater physical and mental health, and be treated with respect in managing their workload in the private sector, why would they opt to work for the state where we are treated like we can't be trusted to manage ourselves or allowed to telework based on operational need?

However, through the years my family situation. Currently, my greatest need would be to have an option for those of us that are caring of very ill and elderly family members or that have other family situations that make it difficult to commute into the office to be able to be exempted from the in-office requirement. We have programs like Paid Family Leave that allow for paid time off to take care of family members, but the needs of aging or ill family members do not always impede our ability to meet our workload commitments and do not meet the requirements for PFL or an RA request. Personally, leaving my mom in the care of a stranger so that I can travel 50 miles to go sit in front of a computer is a big mental, emotional, and financial burden that doesn't make sense when the workload doesn't demand it.

It's far less expensive to catch someone up than to pay for all of the services they will need once they are homeless. 2nd - once someone becomes homeless, we need the ability to get them into mid - term (1-2 year) housing with wrap around services to ensure they can have their physical/mental health needs addressed, get or increase their employment, find childcare if necessary, and save money. During this time, they should also have access to financial literacy education, job training, and if needed, drug treatment programs.

The current process of requesting a lump sum bid and then awarding to the lowest bidder has several problems and ultimately costs the state more money and time in the long run. The contracts team needs to create a database and flag contractors who have defaulted, been previously terminated from a project, or have a track record of poor performance. We have been awarding projects to the lowest bidder without being given an opportunity to determine whether that contractor deserves the right to work on a project. If we can establish a resource to the project managers and contracts team to vet through contractors, we should be able to disqualify a bidder due to poor performance, despite being the lowest bidder. The current process in place is actually costing the state more money and time to handle a poor-performing contractor. In addition, bids are requested as a lump sum. This is problematic for several reasons. Once we award a contract to the lowest bidder, we have no way of knowing if that bid actually includes all the requirements of the contract documents. As the process is currently set up, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure their bids cover the scope, however in several cases, the contractor ends up misinterpreting the scope and/or missing essential work.

6227,,5329a996-429a-4a53-ad32-72db14724f3a,"There are too many review steps in almost every government process. This usually happens because of errors in the process which lead to management wanting additional review to ensure there are less errors. When errors continue to happen, the review level continues to escalate. This results in leadership thinking their staff are unable to complete the task correctly and frustrating staff on the ""moving target"" or unclear expectations caused by various style preferences from different reviewers. This leads to requirements for staff to create additional documentation such as summaries, cover memos, and routing packets to navigate the higher management level reviewing the work. It is extra, non-value added work to explain what the work is why they are approving it. I recommend lowering the approval level to the lowest supervisory level who knows the program. This will reduce turn-around time for requests, improve customer satisfaction (since they get whatever service we provide sooner), increased confidence in employees, and better morale for teams.

It is the one thing that is harming our environment and community the fastest, and nobody seems to be paying attention. Think about it.  People that telecommute can live anywhere else in the world and buy up property that at one time was very cheap.  The remote places and small, quiet, serene towns that some of us love to drive through and visit, will soon not exist at all.  During Covid, I lost half my friends and family who have moved across the country to buy up property that was once inexpensive due to Telecommuting.  Now I don’t see them. Property is now being bought up in droves, which has brought up prices of homes at an astronomical rate.  At this rate, perhaps in as little as 20 years, all those remote places will be gone and the big cities will be unlived, hazardous and unkept.  You think it helps the environment because people don't drive, you are wrong.  People have time to shop online get things delivered to their homes, they no longer support their community like they once did, and that means no more stores or restaurants, and all of those boxes and packing material, where do you think it goes?  And I know for a fact that Telecommuting means you are not as productive.

Here are some of the steps I’ve implemented:

1. SharePoint Site Development
-Centralized and standardized all forms required for my role.
-Used Power Automate to auto-fill redundant fields, reducing repetitive data entry.
-Migrated resources from local drives to the cloud in compliance with IT policies, improving accessibility and collaboration.

2. Interactive Training Resources
-Built a Wiki page to consolidate and standardize the training I’ve received from management.
-Created step-by-step work instructions with embedded GIFs (instead of static screenshots) so employees can visually follow the process in real time.

In most cases, departments are unable to fill vacancies until after the position becomes vacant. This leads to an exodus of knowledge and expertise from the department that is not easily replaced as it often takes years for an individual to become fully proficient in their role, establish connections with others and gain career long learning. While this practice may lead to salary savings, it creates a knowledge deficit which then leads to efficiency loss until such time as the individual staff person learns the position and becomes proficieint and beyond. If departments had the ability to hire replacement staff while the existing staff person was still present, the knowledge transfer would be more streamlined, and the institutional knowledge can be much more easily passed on to the new staff member. An in-between step might involve the creation of desk manuals for new staff to access however these will not necessarily impart the same level knowledge as the in person tutelage of the out-going staff member.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-22T18:23:20+0000,0,"[

Californians want government to have easy to use online tools, one-stop-shop permits, data access portals, and to use the latest technology to make people's lives better. Both IT and non-IT contracts are cumbersome and require navigating gate keepers who do not understand agency needs. If a project is deemed IT by contracting personnel, my agency will simply not move forward. If a contract gets flagged for the PAL process with CDT, the contract is dead, and we will never resubmit. Money lasts 3 years, and the PAL process can take that long, leaving no time for the money to be used on the intended project. Further, getting non-IT contracts through DGS is time-consuming and cumbersome with little added value, decreasing the time for the money to actually do work. 

My suggestion would be to loosen up contract oversight on the frontend, actually provide training to staff, and provide more resources for auditing and enforcement of contract rules and ethics on the backend. In this way, SME staff will be trained on contract creation and execution (which is currently not the case) and can quickly get money out in flexible ways, taking advantage of as much of the 3 year money lifetime as possible, while knowing that they must strictly adhere to contract rules or their money will get pulled back and contracts will get cancelled.

For example, many departments are still relying on PDF forms for timekeeping management, which slows down the processes, increases errors, and limits accessibility.  To solve this I would prioritize modernization of internal systems by moving toward cloud -based, user friendly platforms that allow for real-time updates, digital signatures, and mobile access and also provide adequate training especially for LEADERSHIP! Another major issue is how state departments communicate to the public.  Too often, forms, notices, websites, and presentations are written in dense bureaucratic language that can be confusing.  I would recommend shifting toward PLAIN LANGUAGE communication across all state agencies, making information clear, simple and accessible to all Californians.  Alongside this, we should invest in practical resources like website tutorials, FAQs, or short instructional YouTube videos, that guide people step by step filling out forms and accessing services or joining public online meetings.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T22:15:17+0000,0,"[

Currently, we've created a system where districts spend enormous resources crafting grant narratives that sound impressive rather than implementing practices that actually work.

The Core Problem:
We're funding narrative ability instead of educational effectiveness.

It doesn’t make sense to require the same paperwork for every purchase when the information and compliance status haven’t changed. The redundancy creates excess paperwork, slows down procurement, and adds unnecessary administrative burden for both us and the vendors.

Additionally, requiring a signed RFQ seems redundant when the vendor is already providing an official quote on their company letterhead, which inherently serves as their formal offer.

California’s current model for investigating and prosecuting insurance fraud is fragmented and inefficient. The Department of Insurance (DOI) houses the Fraud Division, a law enforcement unit operating within a regulatory agency. Simultaneously, $80.9 million in annual grant funding is distributed to county District Attorney’s (DA) Offices to prosecute fraud cases. This dual structure presents several challenges:
Conflicting Missions: Regulatory agencies prioritize industry oversight and collaboration, which can conflict with the enforcement and prosecutorial roles of law enforcement.
Operational Inefficiencies: DOI lacks the infrastructure, procurement agility, and legal support systems typical of dedicated law enforcement agencies.
Jurisdictional Gaps: Only counties receiving grants can pursue fraud cases, leaving many areas underserved and creating geographic inequities.
Short-Term Incentives: Grant-based funding encourages quick wins over long-term, complex investigations.
Ethical Concerns: Financial incentives tied to prosecutions raise questions about the impartiality of justice.
Recruitment and Retention Issues: DOI struggles to retain investigators, many of whom leave for better opportunities at the Department of Justice (DOJ).
The Proposed Solution
The proposal recommends transferring the DOI’s Fraud Division (163 peace officers and 75 support staff) and the $80.9 million in grant funding to the California Attorney General’s Office.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-15T19:37:05+0000,3,"[

4726,,2e5a83cf-9a76-4b81-a96e-59ab7a4e835b,"One of the primary problems I would address is the state’s resistance to fully embracing telework, despite clear evidence that it benefits both employees and the public. For decades, Californians have struggled with long commutes, congested freeways, and poor air quality. As a state employee, I see firsthand how commuting drains productivity, raises costs for workers, and contributes to pollution that affects every Californian. Forcing employees back into offices undermines efficiency, increases taxpayer costs for office space and reimbursements, and contradicts the state’s own climate goals.

The solution is simple: expand and normalize telework as the default option whenever the duties of a position can be performed remotely. This requires modernizing policies, investing in secure technology, and measuring performance based on outcomes instead of physical presence. Employees should be trusted to deliver results, and in my experience, productivity and responsiveness actually increase when telework is supported. By keeping more workers at home, California can cut emissions, save money, and provide faster, more effective services to residents. Telework is not just a perk. It is a strategy that addresses climate change, budget efficiency, and the quality of public service all at once.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-22T23:33:45+0000,0,"[

California state departments often operate in silos, with structures built on highly centralized approaches. This creates disconnection across agencies, leading to duplicated efforts, wasted time, resource, and limited collaboration. As a result, departments struggle to share knowledge, coordinate resources, and work toward common goals, reducing overall efficiency and effectiveness. 
Solution: Proposed Solution: Foster Collaboration and Shared Resources
Shift from siloed, centralized structures toward a more connected, collaborative model. This can be done by creating cross-departmental working groups, shared digital platforms, and standardized processes that encourage transparency and knowledge sharing. By streamlining workflows and pooling resources, departments can reduce redundancy, improve efficiency, and deliver more consistent and effective services to Californians.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T19:29:57+0000,0,"[

This creates mismanagement, inconsistent access, and unnecessary strain on both interpreters and the people they serve. A practical, immediate step would be to require each state department that employs ASL Interpreters to have an ASL Interpreter Coordinator—a position held by a qualified interpreter. This model already exists in the State Schools, where interpreters are managed effectively by someone with lived professional expertise. Expanding that model across departments would ensure proper support, accountability, and better access for Deaf/Hard of Hearing employees and clients.
Longer term, California could take a bold step by creating a Department of Language to house and organize all interpreters statewide—including ASL, Spanish, and other languages. This would centralize resources, guarantee professional management by people who understand the work, and ensure that language access is treated as an essential public service. Importantly, this would also allow interpreters to be shared across departments, so that if a DMV office (for example) suddenly needed an ASL Interpreter, the Department of Language could quickly dispatch one.

A solution to solve this problem could be to require all departments to participate in a shared data base, sharing information and working together to have the most up to date information.  Departments could also potentially share the cost of creating such a platform.  This could potentially eliminate some of the separate database changes taking place at other departments and modernize older systems.

The current decentralized approach, where individual departments manage their own IT infrastructure, is inefficient, costly, and misaligned with the state’s legislative intent.

Many state agencies were created to fulfill specific missions—public health, transportation, education, and more. Yet today, these departments are investing significant time, energy, and capital into building and maintaining their own IT systems. This diverts focus from their core responsibilities and leads to duplication of effort, fragmented infrastructure, and inconsistent standards.

The California Department of Technology (CDT) was established to solve this problem. Assembly Bill 2408 and the resulting Government Code provisions laid the foundation for a centralized IT model—one that consolidates services, reduces redundancy, and enables departments to focus on their primary missions while leveraging CDT’s expertise.

Despite this mandate, many departments continue to operate isolated IT silos. This not only undermines the intent of AB 2408, but also wastes taxpayer dollars and slows statewide progress. The result: overlapping systems, inconsistent security protocols, and missed opportunities for innovation.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-08T22:53:06+0000,0,"[

People save significant time by eliminating the need to drive or fly to a hearing, in addition to the carbon emissions from those trips. This change saves average Californians and small businesses hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.

It also saves the state money. California agencies that pay for hearings no longer have to reimburse participants for the time and mileage spent traveling to hearings.

Because government is structured to focus on a need being met, there is little interest in ensuring that the need being met is done in an efficient and cost effective manner. Agencies are punished for not spending all the money allocated to them because the next year, their budget gets reduced. This creates a use it or lose it mentality, and less concern is given on whether we are being good stewards of the public's money. To solve this problem, policies must be set that reward agencies that save the government money rather than penalizing them by reducing their future budget. 

Another problem is that state agencies do not talk to each other.  We are all under the State umbrella, however, no collaboration or connection opportunities exist to be able to compare notes. Most agencies face similar problems and the ability to discuss possible solutions or even understanding what other agencies have done to address their problems is a missed opportunity.  There is no where that allows us to see the organization structure, duty statements, or reports completed by other agencies. There is no directory to reach out to other agencies and collaborate.

The old blueprint no longer fits the realities we face today. We need to reduce redundant frameworks, streamline operations, and encourage departments to consolidate and collaborate across silos. Efficiency shouldn’t be a buzzword—it should be a mandate.
But this isn’t just about internal reform. It’s about reimagining the physical footprint of government. Many office buildings now sit underused or entirely vacant. These spaces represent an opportunity—not a liability. By converting surplus government buildings into affordable housing, we can breathe new life into downtown economies that have long depended on a steady flow of government workers.This kind of transformation would not only address housing shortages but also diversify and strengthen urban centers. It’s a chance to shift from a government-centric downtown to a community-centric one—where people live, work, and thrive in more dynamic, inclusive environments.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-22T18:10:58+0000,3,"[

By shifting to remote offerings, such as the ability to participate in hearings and government decisions by videoconference, we can ensure that people who live in more distant (and often more affordable) areas are given equal opportunities to have their voices heard and contribute to shared goals.

Remote offerings further align with California’s climate goals, avoiding tons of CO₂ that would otherwise be generated as Californians waste time and money driving to formerly in-person meetings. Videoconference offerings also help us include Californians with disabilities who may struggle to join us in person due to challenges with transit and accessibility. 

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many state agencies have vastly enlarged the group of individuals who can participate through the change to remote and videoconference meetings and hearings.

2nd, Prioritize the people who just slipped into homelessness and have potential and will to come out of it. Help them to come out permanently and join mainstream.  Right now, I serve as board member for HART of Folsom, and we are proud to have reduced Folsom's homelessness by 10% this way.
3rd, go deeper and help people that are homeless longer and probably will never come out.  Build shelters with services for them and make rules to humanely require them to take those services. Those rules might curtail some of their freedom, but they should know that it's cost to pay for not being able to come out of homelessness by themselves. 

Finally, to do all this work, encourage and fund the non-profits directly from the state so that the rules are uniform. One positive side effect is that more non-profit jobs are created this way. Each city and county having its own rules and managing and distributing funds will only create more red tape and confusion and dysfunction.

This not only delays critical deliverables but can render documents outdated or irrelevant by the time they are approved. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in collaboration and communication between subject matter experts (SMEs) and executive leadership. This disconnect often leads to a reactive environment where teams are constantly putting out fires instead of proactively identifying and addressing potential issues. Solution: Introduce a tiered review system that empowers mid-level managers and SMEs to approve routine documents without requiring executive-level sign-off. This would reduce bottlenecks, increase accountability, and allow leadership to focus on strategic priorities. Implementing digital workflow tools with built-in version control and approval tracking can also enhance transparency and speed. Establish regular cross-functional strategy sessions between SMEs and executives to align on goals, anticipate challenges, and co-create solutions. This would shift the culture from reactive to proactive, encouraging innovation and long-term planning.

Waterfall is great for smaller projects when one can reasonably estimate the scope, time, and resources needed to complete a project. Agile is better when two of those items are a little fuzzy because the project is large, but it's the only way to get the project to succeed. I have seen projects fail because state control agencies attempt to run projects one way while the department they are overseeing wants to do it the other way. First, CDT needs to have clearly defined approaches for both methodologies. Second, as part of the pre-work (e.g., FSR part), there needs to be an open discussion between CDT and the organization that is undertaking the project about which methodology should be used for the project to level-set expectations. Finally, as part of the FSR process, CDT should insist on receiving an entity-attribute diagram for the data that is passing through the system, so that they know that the IT team understands what it is that they are trying to build. All three of these points will reduce the risk of IT project failure.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-22T23:33:45+0000,0,"[

Measurable results for state agencies require significant projects, supported by proper funding, a strong project team, and effective project management with government oversight to ensure deliverables are met.

In my department, I have participated in several such projects that enhanced both customer service and internal processes. For example, we improved how customers contact us, streamlined the way they receive information, and even developed tools that anticipate and provide needed information before customers realize they need it. These enhancements not only improved efficiency internally but also provided a better overall experience for Californians interacting with the department.

At a more practical level, I have also seen opportunities to improve efficiency by making better use of tools we already have, such as SharePoint, Excel, and OneNote. Often, staff lack training or examples of how to apply these tools effectively. Within my team, we began using SharePoint as a case management tool and OneNote as a shared notebook to store and share information.

The two-week new supervisor/manager training is a waste of time and doesn't cover most of what managers actually face. There are so many leadership development and coaching programs in the private sector that could benefit state employees, like Harvard Business Review or Stanford. Lareg companies often have leadership development tracks. VSP, for example, has two types of tracks you can enroll in -- one for those wanting to become executives and a second track for those who want to be subject matter expert leaders (but not necessarily an exec). They provide mentors, hold classes, and you feel encouraged that you're proactively growing professionally.

Employee management training, specifically, is reactive instead of proactive. I've worked closely with performance management units to discuss personnel issues and sent emails or disciplinary plans for their review. Rather than being trained ahead of time, before issues start, I'm stuck with escalating issues waiting for PMU to review emails and provide guidance. And then their guidance changes frequently depending on what they've recently experienced in court.

Many employees see innovative, research-backed proposals—like expanding remote work, modernizing hiring, or streamlining processes—dismissed not because they lack merit, but because leadership defaults to outdated practices or prioritizes optics over efficiency. This discourages staff from raising ideas and reinforces a culture where “do as you’re told” outweighs evidence-based improvement.

I also believe the state should re-examine how closely it aligns with corporate pressures. For example, enforcing return-to-office mandates to mirror private sector demands undermines both efficiency and equity, especially when research and state audits clearly show that remote work saves millions in costs, improves productivity, and reduces emissions. It is difficult for employees to trust in California’s commitment to innovation when decisions conflict with the very data the state commissions.

From my perspective as a Californian, a government that models fairness, inclusion, and modern workplace practices builds greater public trust. Investing in remote-first policies, skills-based hiring, and leadership accountability would not only improve the employee experience but also deliver better outcomes for the people of California.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-26T16:51:16+0000,0,"[

I would love to one day see the state consolidate multiple departments into something like the FTB campus, freeing up space by making telework the default work type for any position that does not require work to be done in office.

The FTB campus also has lightrail access, as well as a free parking lot, which would be a cost savings to employees who currently work downtown and have to pay for parking. the money saved from things like this could be used to help departments balance their budget and we would be able to better fund things that actually benefit residents of the state. 
I know this is an incredibly lofty idea, and would require a lot of planning, but I think it could provide a great deal of savings, and would make jobs with the state more appealing to most people. if we as a state are committed at being the best, we need to embrace forward thinking tactics, not stick to ""what we always have done""",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T19:57:05+0000,0,"[

From my experience as an employee and union steward, it seems that disabled employees are treated like a burden during the reasonable accommodation process, especially if they are requesting telework. In most cases when the employee's doctor is recommending telework as a reasonable accommodation, departments will do anything to delay or deny telework as a reasonable accommodation. Departments have continually been allowed to ignore and violate the ADA, EEOC, and FEHA policies and regulations and oppose doctor's recommendations for appropriate reasonable accommodations. 

As a whole, the state needs to hold departments accountable for following appropriate policies and regulations pertaining to reasonable accommodations. More timely processes and procedures should be implemented. It is unreasonable to allow each department's EEO unit/section 90 days to investigate themselves, while not providing an employee with a disability their recommended reasonable accommodations. A more consistent and streamlined approach needs to be developed to help support California's employees with disabilities to better provide them more equitable and inclusive work environment when working for the state.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T17:35:42+0000,0,"[

6155,,c92c6ba1-c966-48c3-aaf9-4f418265e451,"Several problems really. But, the first is the integration of newer technology into the workplace. Each State agency has individual IT departments without a centralized, standardized model for operations. Yes, CDT exists, but they have limited control over which systems each agency uses. This minimizes their ability to provide statewide solutions to tech-based problems. It also means that each agency is essentially trying to solve their tech problems independently, sometimes without the necessary expertise to do so. This same idea applies to HR departments. Each HR department is under the guidance of CalHR, but often do things their own way. That lack of standardization causes issues in the short and long term, as policies and procedures are often more at the whim of senior leadership, without a larger strategy, and can even, at times, be in conflict with CalHR expectations. In both the CDT and CalHR cases, having these agencies be the owner of all IT and HR positions that are effectively deployed to other State agencies could resolve the lack of standardization across both critical functions. It ensures that every position receives the same base training for their respective fields, and even centralizes the hiring process for thousands of positions, freeing up other State agency partners to focus on their individual mission areas.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-20T22:13:02+0000,0,"[

This would increase efficiency by enabling the ability of employees to get more done, decrease greenhouse gas emissions from personal vehicles, and save the state money by getting rid of excess office space. 

Many state agencies also make the claim of wanting to increasing employee personal wellness, job/life balance, and spending more time with family. Full-time telework would solve these issues, and many similar ones as well. 

It's time to move forward and embrace new ideas, and more efficient ways of doing things. This takes courage and leadership from the top, which has been in short supply these last few years. Full-time telework is an answer to more government efficiency at all levels, and California should act as the bellwether for all other States to follow on this issue.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-01T00:00:09+0000,0,"[

Rigid minimum qualifications and slow/ouutdated HR protocols block many talented candidates with modern skills from entering public service, which limits innovation and slows progress.

An even larger issue is the state’s approach to workplace flexibility. Despite state audits and extensive research showing that remote work increases productivity, saves the state millions in office space costs, reduces emissions, and improves work-life balance, some leaders continue to enforce return-to-office mandates. This is hypocritical for a government that speaks of innovation, equity, and efficiency while ignoring evidence that remote work achieves those goals more effectively than traditional office models.

To address these challenges: First, modernize hiring by replacing outdated minimum requirements with skills-based assessments and streamlined digital applications. Second, adopt remote-first policies that align with research and fiscal responsibility, prioritizing cost savings, efficiency, and fairness for workers. Third, strengthen protections against retaliation and ensure leadership training emphasizes equity, accountability, and inclusion.

By modernizing hiring and committing to evidence-based remote-first practices, California can move past outdated systems and demonstrate it is serious about equity, innovation, and effective public service.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-26T16:51:16+0000,0,"[

These efforts have not been implemented due to leadership decisions.

Although I may not have been able to directly change the system yet, I continue to look for ways to highlight data, share solutions, and advocate for approaches that align with research and employee needs.

For example, many departments are still relying on PDF forms for timecards and approvals, which slows down processes, increases errors, and limits accessibility.
To solve this, I would prioritize modernization of internal systems by moving toward cloud-based, user-friendly platforms that allow for real-time updates, digital signatures, and mobile access. This would save staff time, reduce administrative burden, and increase efficiency across departments.
Another major issue is how state departments communicate with the public. Too often, forms, notices, and websites are written in dense, bureaucratic language that can be confusing. I would recommend shifting toward plain language communication across all state agencies, making information clear, simple, and accessible to all Californians. Alongside this, we should invest in practical resources like website tutorials, FAQs, or short instructional videos (e.g., YouTube walk-throughs) that guide people step-by-step in accessing services or filling out forms.
Additionally, California has many departments that offer overlapping or complementary services—such as the Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) and the Department of Developmental Services (DDS), which often work with the same populations but in different ways.

Exit interviews should be conducted for every employee, no exceptions, and taken seriously, with actions being put in place to retain future employees. In the first scenario, losing the long-term staff put a massive workload on those of us who stayed, causing a decrease in moral and a loss of historical knowledge, which lead to more staff leaving. The management's poor behavior continued and because no changes were made, the work environment was extremely toxic. In the second scenario, the manager was an extreme micromanager who would single out and belittle staff, frequently teaming up with another manager to gang up on a single staff member.

Therefore, every public program should rigorously evaluate the extent to which programs, and the public resources they administer, strengthen real connections between communities, families and individuals who are in need.  One area of policy this idea could be applied to is homelessness services.  Every homeless person has people who love them and want to help them, but there is often no safe way for family and friends to stay connected and engaged.  Government spending should always start from a place of prioritizing ways that it can strengthen/rebuild a vulnerable person's connectivity to their family and community. That could include creating pathways for a caring family member to make financial contributions to a family member struggling with mental illness or addition that are dedicated to housing, to food, to pro-social activities.

For example, one state department is notified timely that a business has closed or moved to a new location, yet another state department was never notified.  the unversal app solves this problem by streamlining the changes for all departments at once. 

Also, the purpose of developing a universal statewide department cellphone app is to ensure 
1. Efficiencies in collecting state revenues yet simplifying the process for a small business owner to register for state permits and licenses specifically related to their business. 
2. Creating a universal database for state departments to track data.

The roots of this tone and culture originate from the violence of how the USA and all the States gained their legitimacy, through stealing lands, genocide, racism, and continued forms of institutional state oppression. It is as if the USA and States are on constant guard about their legitimacy. This type of defensive, militarized, inhumane tone and culture will eventually turn on itself as we see this happening already at federal government levels through tyranny at the executive branch. It is recommended for State Government to evolve from this militarized, inhumane, inconsiderate manner and approach to one that views State Government as part of humanity the people it governs, instead of its ultimate ruler and oppressor. It is recommended that Law enforcement in CA stop accepting federal funds from JAG and Byrne that incentivize the stop and frisk, arrest, search, and imprisonment of their targeted demographic, specifically poor Black and Brown people, who make up most of the arrests, charges, and imprisonment via the War on Drugs. It is recommended to stop the State corruption of profiting off arresting people of any race or gender, imprisoning them, and causing trauma for the rest of their lives. This trauma is seen in mass homelessness as ex-cons are institutionally excluded from jobs or housing. Law enforcement corruption has caused this problem of homelessness in CA.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-10-15T20:39:39+0000,0,"[

This approach would provide instant communication, ensuring that more people especially those without stable mailing addresses can be reached quickly and reliably.

By transitioning to digital access, the public could view, complete, and submit forms electronically rather than relying on traditional mail. This would significantly reduce printing and postage costs, streamline processing, and enhance overall efficiency.

Number of the individuals my department serves are transient due to unstable housing, making electronic communication far more effective than mail. Allowing technology to replace paper-based processes would not only save government resources but also give the public greater control and faster turnaround times when submitting information. Printing and mailing forms require multiple steps and personnel, consuming unnecessary time and resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. For some people,  unnecessary delays and wait time for benefits can be quite catastrophic and we must at least explore a better process so that we can serve the public better. 
Perhaps a more obvious one is simply finding a way to increase staffing to reduce backlogs which is significantly impacting the public my agency serves. Staffing shortage is very concerning.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-22T16:43:10+0000,0,"[

5923,,679a4c6c-f071-4acc-acb2-34c640db70ee,"A primary problem is the lack of data integration between state systems that serve California's industries. Businesses are often required to submit the same core information, legal name, address, corporate filings, to multiple, separate departments. This creates a fragmented and inefficient experience for them and for us. This data silo effect forces state employees to spend significant time manually reconciling information from different sources, increases the risk of data entry errors, and prevents us from having a clear, holistic view of industry interactions with the state.
Solution:My ideas focus on creating a ""submit once, use many times"" data architecture through two main initiatives:
A Unified Business Portal: We should develop a single, secure online portal to serve as the primary digital entry point for any business interacting with the state. A company could manage its profile, permits, and filings in one place, and that verified data would automatically populate across all relevant agency systems.
A Standardized Data-Sharing API: To support this, we need to build a modern, secure Application Programming Interface (API). This tool would act as a universal translator, allowing our diverse departmental systems, both legacy and new, to communicate and share common data automatically and securely, eliminating the need for redundant data entry.
To make this actionable, we could launch a pilot program integrating the systems of two or three key departments to prove the",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-08T00:55:55+0000,0,"[

For example, I’ve dedicated personal time to developing a proposal to modernize our departmentwide data infrastructure. I approached this both from the top down—by contributing to department strategic action to re-writing data preservation policy—and from the bottom up—by building user cases that demonstrate practical benefits. On my own, I’ve developed scripts to streamline workflows and integrate processes that were previously manual and siloed.

At the same time, I’ve found it challenging. My proposal for a modern data stack hasn't really 'caught fire' there. In fact, you could say it backfired on me. It didn't ignite innovation; instead, it felt a bit more like – drawing trouble to myself.  Things have pretty much stalled out. It's been a bit frustrating, to be honest – sometimes my ideas get totally sidelined, or I end up doing really repetitive, manual tasks that feel like a step backward.  It’s clear that breaking down silos and advancing modernization is larger than what can be achieved in my current role alone. Still, these experiences reinforce my belief that a more integrated, cloud-based approach would significantly improve efficiency and service delivery across the State.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-09-19T18:25:20+0000,0,"[

Office of State Publishing. The mandate to pay more for a lower quality product is counter productive. The savings does not equate to the personnel and infrastructure expense. We can produce superior products for less in private industry. 

Prison Industries, the requirement to purchase furniture from them at often prices exceed 300% more than the same higher quality item for elsewhere. We are forced to pay $700 for a $60 office chair. If it’s more than 10% over a competitor price for like item, we should have an automatic exception from the requirement to purchase from them. 

Small Businesses. State mandated purchasing for high price items also causes appalling markups to costs. Though it may support small business it costs the state an exorbitant amount of money. Because of procurement limitations this essentially forces the state to pay 15-80% more for a product if it’s above $9,999. Our procurement limitations/rules create a massive expense to the state.

While this may maintain stability, it can also limit innovation and discourage growth among both workers and leaders.

I believe that true leadership development means breaking this cycle and fostering a culture where leaders are empowered to challenge the process, question outdated methods, and seek improvements that benefit both employees and the public we serve. By emphasizing open communication and a willingness to innovate, we can build leaders who not only draw from their experience but also strive to leave systems better than they found them. For me, ‘challenging the process’ is not about disregarding tradition, but about ensuring we continually evolve to meet the needs of Californians with greater efficiency, safety, and accountability.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T23:09:21+0000,0,"[

Solution: Radical, trailblazing idea to overhaul state service and incentivize employees at all levels. Throw out what you about state service entirely. Clean slate. Ready? Here is the concept: Departments have employment bands. Imagine layered cake - at the bottom is entry-level band, then above that is the supervisor band, the analyst band, manager and, chief band. That is it for positions. Each band incorporates all jobs for those positions. Every 8-12 weeks, staff can rotate to another job - let's call them ""missions"". To move up a band, you have to complete X number of missions and have led X number of missions successfully. Every employee must complete at least 2 missions annually. This kills silos, creates an innovative and growth mindset culture, creates competition, provides constant learning and gamification, etc. Each mission you complete you get a deliverable in hand to show the work you did with a score for your input. There is a list and those with the most missions and missions led, with good scores, are at the top, a constant changing leaderboard. This leaderboard is used to decide who moves up a level when there's an opening. Pay scales with tenure, not position, so you could decide not to move up a band. Folks would need to be focused, quick learners, with high accountability, excellent collaboration... tune in to my next post to see how we find these employees!",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-25T22:50:35+0000,0,"[

Allowing people to telecommute is good for the environment, reduces traffic, and increases a department's ability to fill positions. I don't telecommute myself, but I think telecommuting should remain an option. If more people could telecommute, that means they can live anywhere. Spreading out the demand for housing outside of the Silicon Valley, Sacramento, and Los Angeles may help decrease the overall prices in those already congested areas. 

The state already owns a lot of land. Build work centers (hoteling?) for state employees in different areas where housing is cheaper. Build employee housing at places like Napa State Hospital to attract good candidates and keep them. We have a high turnover and our employees commute from all over.

This message from the commissioner and management is not going to motivate us or drive performance. As a state employee, I previously valued my work, my team, and the contributions I make every day.

Streamlining Application Processes: In some departments, employees have worked to simplify and digitize application processes for various licenses and permits. This often involves reducing paperwork, implementing online submission systems, and automating routine tasks. These changes can significantly reduce processing times and improve customer satisfaction.

Implementing Feedback Systems: Establishing robust feedback mechanisms allows departments to gather input from the public and employees. This feedback can be used to identify pain points and areas for improvement. For example, some agencies have introduced regular surveys and suggestion boxes, leading to actionable insights and subsequent process enhancements.

Cross-Training Employees: By cross-training employees, departments can ensure that staff members are versatile and capable of handling multiple roles. This flexibility can lead to more efficient operations, especially during peak times or when there are staff shortages.

Adopting Lean Principles: Lean principles focus on eliminating waste and optimizing workflows. Some state employees have successfully applied these principles to reduce unnecessary steps in processes, leading to faster and more efficient service delivery.

First, there should be increased access to information both internally and externally. Information is power and when we equip individuals with knowledge they may be able to solve problems. 

Next, reducing crime and fraud in the State systems. Implementing systems similar to those in the State Fund Special Investigation Unit (SIU) throughout the State in other agencies to spot fraud. Finally, looking for what areas we depend on the Federal Government and begin to reduce that dependency. Chart specifically where we receive the Federal Funding and begin to systematically self fund those areas. If we are not able to self fund look at reductions or creating alternative structures. As the 4th largest economy in the world we should be able to accomplish this task. 

Lastly, we need to create a State Insurance model for homeowners, auto and business insurance. We cannot be held hostage to national carriers that cherry pick and can chose to come and go from the California when it suits them. We can model rates and create programs that lead the way of the future in insurance modeling.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-27T16:30:55+0000,0,"[

There should be standardized templates that state employees in a buying role can use for their contracts and solicitations. Similar to the CMA Model Template that the CSU and UC universities use. It's a required template used for all contracts and grants with CSUs and UCs. DGS should develop standard templates for contracts and solicitations that can be used by all departments. This would streamline the contracting process tremendously. It creates uniformity, and will increase the review and approval process by departments internal processes, as well as DGS' Procurement Division and Office of Legal Services. It would also impact the prospective contractors that are interested in bidding on our solicitations. If I build an RFP today, it likely looks drastically different from another department's RFP. The content may capture the same info - however, where the information might be found in the solicitation, and the formatting of the solicitation, would be drastically different from others. RFPs can be hundreds of pages, and can be overwhelming for contractors. A standardized contracting template, and a standardized solicitation template for things like RFPs and IFBs - would save the State time and money across the board.

This helps identify gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement. Once those gaps are clear, I prioritize the areas that can have the greatest positive impact, and then design the future state around those priorities. For example, in leading the upcoming migration of the DHCS website from SharePoint to WordPress, I created a detailed journey map of the contributor workflow. This revealed where contributors were experiencing friction, such as redundant review steps and inconsistent remediation processes. By documenting these pain points, I was able to propose streamlined workflows, standardized training, and clearer content governance, improvements that will make the publishing process more efficient and the website more user-friendly. 

Improved Version:
Whoever is leading this effort should begin with discovery, connecting with department heads to understand their goals and priorities. From there, work together to build a shared vision for the future of California. Once that vision is established, you can integrate the issues and solutions identified from the ground up. This creates a two-way approach: bottom-up insights from staff and top-down alignment from leadership, which can then be captured in a cohesive diagram of the future state.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-08-21T19:29:57+0000,0,"[

Collaboration and breaking down silos would lead us to be more efficient and make better use of expertise within and across agencies and departments. 

Mismanagement is another very common problem I observe in state service. There are very few effective managers who support and empower staff to do their work effectively. Others are either totally checked out and non-responsive, or are some of the worst micromanagers I have ever encountered. So many times I see the state put forth goals for improving state service that ignore these issues. Hiring the right people won't matter if they don't get the support they need to do the work.

This isn’t innovation—it’s inertia.

Take the push to return employees to the office four days a week. That’s a straightforward directive, but it sidesteps the harder, more meaningful challenge: making departments truly more efficient. It’s easier to mandate physical presence than to rethink workflows, modernize systems, or confront outdated bureaucratic habits.

The pandemic was a once-in-a-generation disruption that forced us to reevaluate how we work. It showed us that change is possible—and sometimes necessary. Yet instead of building on that momentum, many agencies are retreating to old norms. That’s not just a missed opportunity; it’s a failure to evolve.

The most urgent transformation we need isn’t logistical—it’s cultural. We must shift from a mindset of comfort and repetition to one of curiosity, accountability, and continuous improvement.

Nothing kills a team faster than a leader who doesn’t trust them.  Leaders—your people aren’t there to make you look good. You’re there to make them successful. Without them, you don’t have impact. You have a title. Lead with trust. The results will take care of themselves.

There is misalignment, miscommunication, trust, and a continued need to break down the silos. Also, for women in leadership: women should be lifting up and celebrating the successes of others. There is a lot to be gained from learning from others.

Lastly, leaders, managers, supervisors: do not elevate yourself on the backs of others.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-15T21:11:38+0000,39,"[

For example, we typically have one biologist assigned to cover 2-3 counties in the Bay Area. That single biologist is responsible for managing thousands of acres of CDFW lands, responding to human-wildlife conflict incidents in the counties they cover, AND monitoring/studying various taxa of wildlife, whether it be threatened and endangered species on our lands or game species. The vast majority of the time, we receive calls from the public about injured wildlife or smaller wildlife that are stuck in netting or fences, etc., and we do not have the level of staff or resources to address such calls. Which leaves the public asking: ""If animal services won't address this and you guys can't address it, then who will?"" To which the answer is, sadly: nobody. We used to have temporarily funded conflict wildlife staff who could help address such calls - and we do not have them anymore - and our wildlife and public affected by such wildlife suffer the consequences - and it doesn't make the Department look good when we aren't able to address such calls on a more regular basis.

We accelerated the digitization of our processes, shifting away from paper-heavy workflows and outdated systems. This wasn’t just about convenience; it was about survival. By streamlining operations and cutting through layers of bureaucracy, we empowered teams to do their jobs more effectively and with greater autonomy.

We also introduced flexibility for employees—something that had long been resisted. Remote work options, flexible schedules, and trust in individual accountability led to a noticeable boost in morale. People felt seen, respected, and more engaged.

Perhaps most importantly, we reimagined how we communicate within the department. Barriers broke down, silos dissolved, and collaboration became more fluid.

I say this because I have seen the state increase the use of ""licensed"" BU 9 staff when a license is not necessary to complete the work. DGS' Division of the State Architect, the Building Standards Commission, and the Office of Sustainability, as well as CalTrans previously hired non-licensed employees to complete the work that does not require a license. 

However, in the past decade these Departments/Divisions/Commissions have stopped using classifications that do require a license. The problem is that the work required by these entities can be completed by a combination of licensed and unlicensed staff, but by hiring only licensed staff, the state is wasting hundreds-of millions of dollars. 

A licensed architect/engineer gets paid (after benefits) $250k/year or more. An unlicensed person doing the work that doesn't require a license gets paid $150k/year. Multiply that $100k/year savings by the thousands of staff at DGS and CalTrans that are paid for their license but don't perform license-level work.

By hiring unlicensed staff to do the unlicensed work, there is also an opportunity for the state to recruit and maintain staff. 

But STOP paying licensed BU 9 staff to do work that non-licensed staff can do. It will save the state at least 1/2 a billion dollars.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T16:21:32+0000,0,"[

The Problem - For services that require an in-person visit, like at the DMV, residents often must take significant time off work to wait in a physical line, sometimes for hours. This is lost time and productivity for the public, and it creates crowded, stressful office environments. The Solution: Implement and standardize a digital queuing system for all high-volume state service centers. Using a mobile app or website, a Californian could join the line for a specific service remotely. See their real-time estimated wait time. Receive a notification when it's their turn to head to the physical office. This tool-based solution respects the resident's time by turning hours of passive waiting into productive time they can use at home or work. It makes the experience vastly more efficient and user-friendly.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-10-08T00:55:55+0000,0,"[

Solution 1 - Make software training and tool updates easier to find and advertised. This includes Microsoft products and new tools.  There are tools out there we don't know about which can be useful as changes come, or new tools are available.

Issue 2 - Too much internal Spam.
Solution 2 - Set standard subject lines for Department/Statewide emails to better filter them to email folders. E.g. use ""Job Posting"" at the beginning of the subject for any kind of new or backfill positions being advertised.

Issue 3 - Reasonable Accommodation (RA) process.
Solution 3 - Allow 1st or 2nd level supervisors/managers to determine RA approval, and not have it go to headquarters.  IF denied, then the employee should have the option to push it up the chain.  HQ is a bottleneck and some folks have to wait 6 months or more for approval.

Issue 4 - Inflexible Telework
Solution 4 - Allow more flexibility of telework schedule by having 1st or 2nd level supervisor/manager to determine viability of telework for the position and the schedule (required in office vs. remote time), instead of one size fits all coming from headquarters or statewide.

Issue 5 - Most forms not e-sign ready

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generator) systems make decisions based on explicit criteria, not writing quality. This is a LLM (Large Language Model) utilizing only documents that have been curated.
Consistent application of standards regardless of reviewer mood or workload
Transparent decision logic that can be audited and explained

Cost Reduction Through Intelligence:

80%+ of applications would never need a review by a human, dramatically reducing staff costs
Human reviewers focus only on genuine edge cases requiring judgment
Real-time feedback eliminates multiple submission cycles

Outcome Focus:

The system learns from actual grant performance, not just compliance
Evidence-based interventions get prioritized automatically
Continuous improvement based on what actually works for students, data would drive decisions.

Practical Implementation Notes:

Start Small: Begin with one grant program (maybe Perkins V) to prove concept and refine algorithms
Data Integration First: The auto-population from existing systems is crucial - RAG works best when it has complete, accurate data
Change Management: Frame this as ""freeing staff to focus on helping districts succeed"" rather than ""replacing human judgment""
Transparency: Make the AI decision logic completely visible to districts - they should understand exactly why they were approved/denied","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-03T16:29:58+0000,0,"[

One of the largest financial burdens of this department is the amount of movement made for inmates (i.e. transfers from one prison to a different prison).  Specifically, when an inmate's mental health level of care is changed to a ""higher"" level of care (i.e. to EOP, ICF, Acute, MHCB), the inmate is transferred ""short-term"" to a different prison.  This transfer takes multiple Correctional Officers driving across the state to take the inmate from Point A to Point B.  As the Mental Health level of care is temporary, they are transferred back (or to a new prison) within a short period of time.  The same inmates are transferred many times throughout the year, whenever their Mental Health changes. 

In my opinion, it would be cheaper, more cost effective, and more efficient, if each prison had the appropriate staff at that prison to treat that inmate's mental health level of care. So... don't transfer the inmate from Point A to Point B multiple times; keep the inmate at Point A, and have on-site staff treat the inmate.

We already pay with our time to commute, we pay for car insurance, we pay for gas, and to pay to park when we have to return to the office is a financial stressor for many employees. There are additional hidden fees of employment besides what is already taken from our checks.

For example, the Communications Operator classification in Siskiyou County currently offers the same pay as in San Diego County, despite the significant difference in cost of living — with housing costs in San Diego nearly triple those in Siskiyou. This imbalance contributes to low tenure and retention within the classification, especially in higher-cost regions.

If the state were to establish automatic stipends or geographic pay adjustments, similar to those used by the federal government and based on GSA locality rates, it could make these positions more competitive and appealing to prospective candidates.

For staff that still must come into the office for a legitimate in person requirement (processing mail, etc), multiple departments can consolidate into existing State owned buildings.  The Franchise Tax Board campus would be a great place to consolidate these staff.  There are multiple buildings to house different departments with free parking.

Staff that get to telework 100% would be much happier and more productive at work and at home.  It was proven to work during the pandemic.  There was never a problem with full time telework and it didn't need to go away.  Staff in positions that can't telework would have something to strive for in future positions.  The State government would be able to obtain the best talent away from the private sector and offer a new incentive to work for the government.  Taxpayers would be happy to see the cost savings.

I suppose the only people unhappy with full time telework would be urban business owners.  It is said that urban areas hurt when people telework.  But there are winners and losers in everything in life.  For every downtown business owner that is unhappy, there is a business owner in the suburbs that is getting more business.

While there are a ton of dedicated and competent employees, there are also those that utilize the protections afforded to public employees and those in unions to not meet even minimum potential. To solve this problem, I think we should ensure that employees and supervisors are being periodically checked in on. I have had three roles within the state government since 2021 and have never had a performance review or worked with a supervisor on a plan for trainings or moving forward in my career.

While I understand that salaries can improve over time through merit-based increases in line with the classifications pay scale, the reality is that many state positions, some of which require degrees and several years of relevant experience, start out with compensation that is classified as low income under both state and federal income limits in numerous counties. These are not entry level roles, yet the starting pay often does not reflect the level of responsibility, expertise, or the cost of living in the areas we serve.

Public service is deeply meaningful and essential work. Most of us do not enter this field with the expectation of becoming rich. However, when experienced professionals are struggling to meet basic living expenses, it creates an external burden that can impact their ability to perform at their highest potential. Financial stress can affect focus, morale, and long-term retention, ultimately impacting the quality of service we provide to the public.

Addressing this issue would not only support the well-being of dedicated employees but also strengthen the effectiveness and sustainability of our workforce. Investing in fair and competitive compensation is an investment in the quality and continuity of public service.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-16T19:50:34+0000,0,"[

They have generally larger and more complicated sites, but many of their cases would have been closed years ago if assigned to other agencies. Sometimes it feels analogous to assigning a Homicide Detective to investigate a traffic ticket. Perhaps reducing the number of reviews and ""draft Final Final"" report reviews is in order?

As a manager, I try and involve my staff as much as possible and solicit their feedback before making decisions on particular course of action that will directly affect them and their workload. I work at a smaller department and my team oversees a wide array of administrative functions, and I frequently try and remind myself that I am not always going to be the subject matter expert who has the answers to every question that comes up. We need to trust our staff because oftentimes they know things that us managers may not, and we must always embolden them to share their feedback, ideas, and expertise.

Particularly when it comes to mental health. There are so many available reimbursement sources that very few victims actually why not getting paid out compared to the number that are denied. There are a number of places where the program itself could make changes to regulation or their guidelines and policies to result in fewer denials.

There are only OP's that show and ends to a mean but doesn't show how to get there. It is up to the managers and past employees (if you're fortunate enough to be enlightened by their strategies) to aide us on how to complete our job in the most efficient manner. To that I'd like to state that when an employee promotes, transfers, or leaves CDCR completely, there is no overlapping of employment of the predecessor and successor for training. When an employee assumes a position for the first time, that employee must learn to govern themselves. They must teach themselves to be efficient and make the most out of their time. With that said, I think all employees have had to invent ways or utilize methods to ensure efficiency, whether self-taught or passed down from their predecessor- nothing is put in place to give employees direction on best practices to ensure work is completed in a tried-and-true efficient manner. There is nothing for employees to utilize and build on to tailor it for their institution specific duties.

4474,,1611b5d9-7fbb-4be5-9fb2-f5effd7543db,"Outdated minimum qualifications and lack of ability to promote in place which leads to a lack of expertise in state positions.

For lack of expertise in state positions, low paying and low qualification positions see high turnover. In administrative units we lose someone with years of knowledge and experience so that they can promote. That person is worth more in their current position with the knowledge they have amassed. If they are eligible to apply to a higher administrative position, they should be eligible to promote in place. The high turnover makes state processes extremely slow as we wait for someone to be trained or wait for the position to be filled. 

For outdated minimum qualifications, an example is the Water Resource Control Engineer position. It requires a limited type of degree from a limited set of schools, yet engineers at other agencies (such as CalTrans, air resources, CalFire, etc.) allow for engineers that have an EIT and are on the licensing path (which is allowed by the Board of Licensing for engineers). This limits our pool of qualified candidates, when there are licensed civil engineers who cannot be hired because of outdated qualifications.

-Not knowing how to shut down a computer or the difference between shutting down, restarting, sleep, and closing the lid.
-What file explorer is and how to navigate network folders.
-How to use the search (Windows key) to find stuff.
-How to connect to the WIFI and VPN.

That is why I think we need some sort of basic computer literacy exam before people can apply for a job. Maybe add it as a component in CalCareers.

I take pride in helping individuals and teams discover their 'Why' both personally and organizationally. Therefore, they can connect with their purpose, love what they do, and ultimately make a greater impact. Supporting others in finding that clarity and alignment is incredibly fulfilling, and it’s what drives me every day. My personal Why is to make my grandma proud. 

To make California’s government more effective and efficient, we need to prioritize human connection in the workplace. By creating safe spaces, motivating our employees, developing their skills, and consistently reminding them of the value they bring, we empower them to become the best version of themselves. When employees feel valued and cared for, they perform better, contribute more meaningfully, and help build a stronger, more effective government. I believe in dreaming big, staying positive, and starting small, because small actions often lead to the biggest impact.

Yes, I’ve seen and contributed to more effective and efficient service within the State.

I was picking up something inter-office today and heard finger pointing on a department meeting that could be avoided with simple process improvement protocols. There's a lot of wasted time on meetings that have no clear goals/agenda/template/time constraints, redundancy in process due to lack of process awareness and documentation, no standardized document management protocols, no clear mission of waste reduction, hierarchical structures are preached rather than going direct to a solution which wastes enormous time and hinders solution iteration/revision/implementation, not offloading to contractors the busywork related to their contract housekeeping, etc. Lean culture needs to be implemented asap with everyone trained in Lean methodologies so the mission is clear and the Gemba is understood to be open and the org chart flat for these purposes.

There is no real-time visual summary of statewide sources of funds (revenues) and uses of funds (money spent on programs and services). The absence of real-time data on revenues and expenses may make it challenging for lawmakers, control agencies and constituents to manage/adjust their budgets based on the latest info. 


SOLUTION

Create an online visual tool with real-time data of sources of funds (from CDTFA, FTB, etc.) and uses of funds (to the General Fund, special funds, and locals). 

This would enable lawmakers, control agencies and the public to have a better understanding of the current financial state of revenues and expenses overall as well as to individual programs.

Strong managers use the STD 638 to offer the truly earned feedback, where mediocre managers often rank everyone as ""M"" and provide little, if any,  constructive feedback there or in day-to-day interactions. For those who have been over-achievers all of our lives, to have a mediocre manager provide this is frustrating and off-putting. Encourage managers to work hard on these as this engagement will motivate staff, support professional growth and ensure that high performers feel valued. Less effective managers tend to provide only average or generic reviews, even for excellent employees, without offering guidance on how they can advance. This lack of feedback discourages staff and can hinder development. Additionally, promotions should be based on demonstrated leadership qualities rather than circumstance. A stronger vetting process is needed to ensure promotions go to those who consistently model dedication and performance. HR should also allow and encourage higher rankings for employees who truly give 110%. When staff exceed expectations but their reviews do not accurately reflect their effort, it creates deep frustration and drives talented employees to consider leaving for agencies where their contributions will be recognized.

Having spoken with many relatives and friends who are employed with the State in various different departments and agencies, there is simply not enough work assigned to each employee.  For example, employees are assigned a weekly workload that are able to be accomplished within a day or less and as a result, employees have nothing to do for the remainder of the week.  This may be caused by the fact that there are excessive number of employees assigned to a specific project/assignment/role.  Employees who speak up to seek more work are often frowned upon because their peers do not want to be assigned more work.  Employees who are comfortable with their low workload would not speak up (and sometimes even exaggerate how ""busy"" they are) in order to preserve their low workload.

As a hard-working State employee and a California taxpayer, I believe the State needs to do a thorough time study to evaluate the amount of work being performed by State employees and determine if there is sufficient workload assigned to employees before considering to hire more people.  Highly recommend that the time study is conducted by auditors or a third-party and not conducted internally or ""self-assessed"" workload analysis because there will be inherent biases.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T19:02:12+0000,0,"[

Managers spend a lot of time correcting timesheets and answering questions about leave balances, instead of working on program goals.  I suggest enhancing the Cal Employee Connect platform at SCO, to identify what payroll codes stand for and how to use them.

The entry for ""PH"" has an information symbol that states, ""This entry is measured in Units and must be used in full Units increments.""  This is helpful to know, but many employees may not know what ""Units"" or ""full Units increments"" means. ""Units"" is capitalized, indicating there is a definition somewhere, but that information has to be hunted down. While I can find this information, it would save me time if employees could easily find this information themselves, and understand how to use the different leave categories, at the same time as checking their leave balances.

During a disaster, such as the Mammoth Snow Incident, The January Fires (2025), and the Texas Flooding (EMAC-HR K9 MRP), Traditional purchasing methods like purchase orders or contracts are to slow and can endanger public health, safety, and property.

Acquisition outside of normal business hours: Disaster often occurs at unexpected times, such as nights and weekends. CAL-Cards provide a payment mechanism that functions at all hours when supplies are available.
Elimination of red tape: The Emergency Response CAL-Card ERC (Emergency Response CAL-Card) program is specifically designed to cut through bureaucracy for disaster response. It is intended for use after the Governor’s Office has issued a disaster proclamation and when other payment mechanisms are unavailable.
Flexibility with vendors: Unlike standard purchasing, the ERC (Emergency Response CAL-Card) has a broad allowance for merchant categories, giving card holders the flexibility to purchase from vendors that are accessible and have the needed supplies and services during emergencies.
Recommendation:
Authorize and issue CAL-Cards to all Special Operations Assistant Chiefs to:

•	Support fiscal accountability and streamline reimbursement processes

In my experience, onboarding and training contractors can be time consuming, and often their staff do not fully understand program policies or the scope of work. This can lead to inconsistent messaging and confusion for the Californians we serve. Many of these vendors are also based out of state and may not fully grasp the unique needs of our communities.

I believe we should explore bringing more of this work in house. For example, having state employees handle case management could improve consistency, accountability, and transparency. It would also allow us to better control outcomes, reduce excessive billing, and build internal capacity by developing staff skill sets.

While contractors can play a role, I think a more balanced approach with a stronger in-house presence would ultimately lead to better service delivery and public trust.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-16T19:50:34+0000,0,"[

5763,,5eaf68d3-919c-4835-9e6b-7fea43cf149b,"Idea: Reform or eliminate CDT’s duplicative IT project procurement oversight process.

Rationale:

Inefficient use of resources: Current CDT oversight adds layers of redundant review and documentation that consume millions in staff hours and consulting costs, without measurably improving project success rates.

Delays delivery: The additional procurement checkpoints extend timelines, often by several months, discouraging innovation and responsiveness.

Limited accountability: Oversight bodies rarely bear responsibility when projects fail, creating a misalignment between authority and accountability.

Alternative Approach:
Shift to agency-led, outcome-based accountability:

Empower departments to own their projects end-to-end, while holding them accountable, to iterate, hold departments accountable, for cost, schedule, and performance.

Replace CDT’s checklist-style oversight with independent milestone reviews (e.g., external auditors or peer agency reviews) tied to measurable deliverables.

Adopt modular, milestone-based procurement (similar to private sector best practices) that enables course correction without massive sunk costs.

Expected Impact: Faster project initiation, lower administrative overhead, clearer accountability, and better use of taxpayer dollars.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-30T21:55:07+0000,0,"[

From my anecdotal observations, we have a poor hiring process for managers and tend to promote people into management roles without the skills, knowledge or abilities to be a manager. I noticed we promote those who may have good supervisory skills into management roles, but not necessarily management skills.

I would prefer CDCR to look outside the department to staff management roles. We currently tend to have an unofficial requirement to come ""up the ranks"" to staff management positions when getting someone ""off the streets"" may be of better value as a manager. Supervisors and staff must be technical experts; managers need to manage. 

Additionally, we tend to undervalue education in this department. I believe having a relevant education should be strongly considered for promotion. Many studies have proven the value of education, and I never understood why CDCR's hiring practices put no value in having an education. If I were able to make the decision, I would require a BS degree and experience to be interviewed for a management position.

My suggestion is to allow for more open forums on what programs the public actually wants and needs to best serve them, and then make sure those programs are more well thought out before implementing.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-19T19:32:03+0000,0,"[

On one hand, there is a strong emphasis on rewarding current civil service experience, while on the other, external candidates are expected to meet disproportionately high educational and experiential thresholds. For instance, some classifications equate one year of state service to a master’s degree plus three years of professional experience. This raises a critical question: how can a single year of internal service be considered equivalent to such extensive academic and professional preparation? This practice not only undermines the value of formal education and diverse professional backgrounds but also creates systemic barriers for qualified individuals outside the state system—effectively making the process exclusionary.

To improve both efficiency and equity in hiring, California should implement a transparent, competency-based hiring framework. This would involve clearly defining the skills, knowledge, and outcomes expected for each classification and allowing candidates—whether internal or external—to demonstrate their qualifications through a combination of experience, education, and performance-based assessments. Such a model would reduce arbitrary equivalencies, promote fairness, and ensure that the most capable individuals are selected to serve the public, regardless of their entry point into government.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-23T22:20:42+0000,0,"[

Many police agencies have adjusted to the times and now allow officers to wear well groomed beards and display tattoos that are of good taste and not objectively offensive.  However, the California Highway Patrol has not allowed tattoos to be displayed nor male officers to have beards, all for the sake of tradition.  Our modern culture has grown to accept both as acceptable in the workplace, and in fact, makes officers more relatable.  Many communities may be able to relate to an officer who has tattoos, especially younger people.  As the melting pot of the United States, many foreign cultures co-exist in California and universally respect male officers with beards as being elders with serious life, and job experience, particularly when they see gray in the beard.  This makes them more willing to listen and being compliant with an officer.  It's already permitted for religious exemptions, i.e. for Sikh officers.  It should be permitted across the board for all officers.  This may seem like a non-issue to someone not in law enforcement, but other agencies have noticed higher levels of recruiting and retention by allowing tattoos and beards.  It is also a huge morale booster and allows officers to express themselves as individuals and humans, rather than as de-humanized, monotonous, faceless agents of the government.

And speaking of excel, previously my team would print out lists provided from HQ to do projects. Again these lists are not in an excel format, which makes it difficult to weed out other district office information and focus on my district. So manually, I have to find out what applys to my office. 

In the areas that I can, I have since shifted some of our projects to a shared drive, excel format and we color code what stage of the project my team is working on. When it is ready for my review, I can clearly see which ones need my attention and I can keep tabs in real time with where they are at.

This creates delays, duplicate work, and access issues — especially when PDFs are hard to use on mobile devices or when handwritten forms are difficult to read.

Instead of routing documents for signatures, we can use interactive online forms to collect structured data and automate approvals. Online forms are faster to set up, reusable, and mobile-friendly. They also ensure accuracy by requiring fields, validating entries, and feeding submissions directly into tabular formats like Excel or SharePoint Lists. This eliminates manual transcription, reduces errors, and cuts down on repetitive administrative work.

The benefits are clear:

- Saves time by reducing steps (no printing, scanning, or configuring signatures)

- Improves efficiency with real-time submission tracking and notifications

- Avoids waste by reducing paper use and redundant tasks

- Supports accessibility by providing legible, mobile-friendly entry options for both office and field staff

2 - We need a stable power grid. We retired our nuclear plants even though they're the safest and cleanest source of stable power which our grid desperately needs - especially if we want to move towards all electric cars. Solar is great on existing infrastructure, but we've been clear cutting the forests to build those instead which destroys our beautiful countryside and it only generates power when the sun is shining. We should be developing fusion and building out a grid to support our efforts to reduce carbon emissions and cleaning up our air. We need trees and plants in the cities to help clean the air there and reduce the impact of brake dust and other particulates in the air.

I think some of the excessive purchasing laws and policies make the State purchasing/contracting procedure unnecessarily complex. Simplifying the process and reducing the number of forms needed not only expedites the process but also saves taxpayer money. One example I suggest removing is the DVBE participation requirement in formal solicitations. Almost, 99% of the times, it's been waived due to highly specialised services or other factors. These types of laws and policies do not help DVBEs; they just add additional paperwork and delay the contracting process. Other examples are forms like Darfur, California Civil  Rights Laws Attachment, and Iran Contracting Act Verification that need to be submitted by bidders/contractors, or 113 pages of Telecom General Provisions included in telecom contracts. The lengthy provisions and forms that are never looked at or used for anything waste taxpayer money and complicate the process for companies. Some vendors, especially Small Business suppliers they do not have a lawyer on board to help them understand the State contract provisions and for that reason do not participate in bidding opportunities. There are a lot of requirements during the purchasing process that could be removed or simplified.

California currently has the lowest high school graduation rate in the nation—an alarming fact, especially for a state with the fourth largest economy in the world. We can and must do better for our youth and for the many adults who never had a real chance to earn a diploma.
In California, certain vulnerable student populations—such as those who have experienced homelessness, incarceration, or time in the foster care system—can graduate with a reduced requirement of 130 credits under AB 216. I propose that this same credit pathway be offered to adults, age 18 and older, who enroll in accredited adult school programs.
Many adults who dropped out of high school faced serious obstacles: poverty, family instability, violence in their communities, or disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Without a diploma, these individuals are often stuck in low-wage jobs with little opportunity for advancement.
A HS diploma opens doors to job training programs, community college, military service, and promotions. 
•	The state gains from increased tax revenue as graduates earn higher wages.
•	Adult schools benefit from federal funding tied to improved student outcomes.
•	Employers gain access to a more skilled and motivated workforce.
•	Businesses benefit from the increased purchasing power of newly employed adults.
•	Communities see reduced crime rates and greater social stability.
Expand the 130-credit diploma option to adults. Its a low cost, high impact solution.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-24T21:11:32+0000,0,"[

Unqualified candidates getting hired or promoted due to personal connections, not merit.  Workplace morale and trust suffer when people perceive that opportunities aren't fairly earned. Erosion of public trust (especially in public or regulatory roles) when the public suspects favoritism in staffing.

We should advocate for more transparent recruitment and selection processes. Push for independent hiring panels, blind application reviews, or standardized interviews. Encourage whistleblower protections for those who report unfair practices.

Circumvention of Minimum Qualifications (MQs)

Some candidates may be circumventing qualifications by enrolling in quick, sometimes low-rigor or unaccredited online graduate programs, just to “check the box.”  This undermines the intent of MQs, which are supposed to ensure a candidate has a certain level of baseline expertise.  It can devalue the profession and create inequities against those who pursued more rigorous paths.

We should push for HR and classification teams to clarify standards: not just “enrollment” but substantial progress or completion from accredited institutions. Consider evaluating equivalencies in a more meaningful way — e.g., experience + coursework, or requiring specific coursework from recognized programs.  Advocate for quality assurance checks on accepted degrees — ensuring they come from regionally accredited institutions, not diploma mills or for-profit degree factories.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-19T20:27:09+0000,4,"[

This results in a culture of enforcement over empowerment, where employees often feel undervalued and micromanaged rather than inspired to perform at their best.

Suggested solutions: 

Implement hiring and promotion practices that prioritize: People skills, Proven ability to develop others, and Desire to lead not just manage. Select supervisors based on leadership potential. The work can be learned on the job but emotional intelligence needs to be there before they become a supervisor and have power over peoples careers.

Build accountability for “how” supervisors lead. Tie supervisor performance evaluations and promotions to: Team morale and retention metrics (if there is a high turn-over then something is wrong that shouldn't be ignored), 360-degree feedback from staff (this is one I have implemented upon myself), and Demonstrated leadership behaviors — not just output numbers.

Shift the culture from punitive to supportive. Encourage a workplace philosophy that emphasizes: Employee engagement over enforcement

For example, if HR representatives are dismissive or rude, employees should have a safe and professional channel to raise these concerns. Employees have the right to follow up on matters that directly affect them, and there should be accountability when those rights are not respected.
3.	Transparency in Hiring Practices
I have observed instances where Directors or Deputy Directors appear to hire individuals they have previously worked with. While it is sometimes stated that leadership was not involved in the hiring process, those same individuals are still selected for high-level positions. To avoid the perception of favoritism, greater transparency in hiring practices should be required, including clearer documentation of decision-making and candidate selection.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-23T18:14:28+0000,0,"[

Here's my contribution after working for the State of California on and off for 15+ years.

State salaries
Certain State positions are pigeonhole into arbitrary (or based on outdated data) salary ranges without taking account location and parity with the private sector.

For example, the HFEN (Health Facility Evaluator Nurse) position. A comparable position in the private sector, in the San Francisco area, (according to Google) is around $155K (for a nurse consultant).  My compensation for 2023 according to Transparent California =$98,271.44 (not counting benefits as the average salary quoted by Google does not include benefits)

I've been with the State long enough to know that trying to ask for fair compensation is like trying to get blood from stone. 
I get it. We are painted with the same brush. We are stigmatized as being lazy, inefficient, bureaucratic etc. What tax payers would reward State workers with a pay raise? (slim to none)

So here is my proposal. Don't reward my efficiency with more work and flowery praise. Compensate me financially. There's an Over Time budget within each department. Give me access to the OT budget, I don't mind writing a proposal on how I can increase your/my Department's efficiency or backlogs to solve your problems.

It is a great tool available to the state to foster collaboration and retain highly skilled staff. In my role, I engage with community based organizations, researchers, and local government all across the state. I would not be able to do that without teleconferencing tools and support for telework—even if we had the funds to support travel, I can't be in multiple places at once, and it is more effective to have everyone in conversation together. The State government of California does not only serve Sacramento, yet without telework I am less effectively able to serve communities outside of the Sacramento area. Telework saves money, reduces pollution and traffic, and makes state workers more efficient. I am able to do more work in the same amount of time if I don't have to run around a poorly planned building to find a bathroom or navigate a lengthy commute. When working at headquarters, my colleagues frequently have to interrupt meetings in order to move their cars because we don't have the infrastructure to actually support employees working in the office, even on a 2 day/week in office schedule.

I cannot speak for others, and many roles are critically accomplished through in-person attendance. However, a blanket return to office mandate is out of touch with the ground reality of the public employees who keep the state running.

A blanket RTO mandate also puts undue pressure on departments and individuals to justify exceptions, particularly when it comes to Reasonable Accommodations; especially those RA's addressing invisible disability. Although I am aware (as an EEO investigator) that bad actors try to manipulate these civil protections, folks who have engaged in good faith interactions with their employers for many years are extremely anxious. Although their limitations have not changed, the expectations surrounding their employment will if RTO moves forward in 2026 (which, despite protective statute, is common via employer-friendly interpretations of RA law and policy).

To me, the solution is obvious: reject blanket RTO so departments can TRULY treat each person & job uniquely. In addition to cost saving, the state will retain employees enthusiastic about their jobs and committed to careers that don't pay like the private sector.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T23:14:13+0000,0,"[

S1) Provide open training and learning opportunities to all potential hires to familiarize people with state operations prior to applying. Example: An overview video discussing FI$Cal which is a system that is heavily used by many departments but would be unknown to anyone outside of state work.
P2) Management do not seek the opinions of rank-and-file staff when proposing changes, limiting the potential for innovative ideas
S2) Implement systems like Engaged California on a department level.
P3) State exams that test experience, education, and training do not accurately test whether a candidate is fit for a position
S3) Phase out this type of exam, as it only provides unnecessary hurdles to qualified candidates, and give more discretion to departments to hire candidates. Hiring process would still check Minimum Qualifications for the position.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T17:33:27+0000,0,"[

Processes like contracting have extremely specific protocols and therefore very specific training. Whenever we lose an employee, that gap can take over a year to fill and the next person might take over a months to over a year to get up to speed. This issue also dovetails into the issue of severe under staffing. Some units are operating at well under 50% of the necessary staff, or even more. When appropriately staffed units need to interface with those who have poor staffing, that causes bottlenecks which lead to months of delay. There just are not enough people to do the jobs necessary to keep the fundamental processes of our bureaucracy moving smoothly.

The biggest issue that I noticed from day one is the amount of bureaucracy that envelops almost every aspect of how the State operates. I pretty much knew that going in, but when I actually experienced it I was kind of shocked. Everything is just so difficult! I'm used to having ownership of my role and various tasks and getting things handled quickly - not having to go through 15 people for something or having to wait 8 months for a PO and then supervisor approval and to only order something from one specific place, for example. Also, I get a lot of emails and phone calls from the public and it can be incredibly difficult trying to determine who to forward to. I often go to our website and sit there scrolling through trying to find the info myself, with much difficulty. 

Oh and the way people make payments online - the entire system needs to be overhauled. All of the phone calls I receive are either about duplicate payments on their credit card, or they couldn't log in to their account to make their payment. I then have to take down all their info and email my contacts to ask them to help. Takes a lot of time!

1. Currently, the ADA and other state laws do not apply to rental housing (especially single-family homes) as well as new homes. Because of this an individual with a disability cannot get a home that has a ramp, walk-in shower, light-based fire alarm, or tactile controls. Many of these adaptations are available by default when accessing public facilities and commercial organizations open to the public. Yet, in the context of housing people with disabilities have to spend tens of thousands to make these conversions. There are exceptions for affordable housing, not all people are eligible for these opportunities. The State should make an effort to make sure accessibility is improved, so that homes are available that meet these requirements and the option to make these changes in new homes by lowering barriers.
2. Many states including Washington, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Massachusetts have Medicaid working disabled programs that operate without income or asset limits. This assists individuals with disabilities would like to work but cannot because insurance does not cover services like long-term care. To ensure that these programs remain financially viable the states have imposed premiums of at least 7% of a person's income. California should consider similar programs.

The public needs to be aware that they are tapping into the tax reserves of the employers when leveraging these UI benefits and that they should not be abusing the opportunity to benefit from these resources as a matter of sustaining our economic structure.

Although these travel trips for trainings are exciting and refreshing, the return on investment is not enough to justify training trips. In most circumstances, lower paying classifications would benefit more from having a higher salary rather than going on a state sponsored training trip. Office Assistants and Office Technicians are more likely to quit or leave for higher paying jobs because these classifications do not make livable wages. California is expensive to live independently and there is more value in paying these classifications more, and less value in paying for travel and training expenses when employees in these classifications are highly likely to change jobs for something that pays more. The citizens of California would benefit more from having higher paying entry-level jobs in these classifications. Most people don't care about going on a state sponsored training trip when they are going to come back to a mediocre salary. They'll just leave for a higher paying job, thus resulting in funding and resources being wasted on that employee.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-22T23:33:45+0000,0,"[

Like many here, I've worked at different departments over several years and it’s become incredibly challenging to recruit and retain talented professionals. Telework and statewide hiring in the early 2020s helped us recruit skilled professionals from across the state. But now, with pay falling behind the private sector, few opportunities for advancement, and new in-office requirements, we lost dedicated employees who have years of experience and institutional knowledge, and try to replace them (if we can), which is expensive and slow. 

One of the biggest reasons people choose state service is PSLF. Recent proposed federal changes that raise monthly repayments upwards of 500% and will likely disqualify employees from certain states have taken that recruitment/retention tool away. 

I believe CA should create its own Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) for state employees. We already have successful models with the CA Legislature authorizing an LRAP through CalATJ for legal aid attorneys, and CalHealthCares using Prop. 56 funds to offer up to $300,000 in loan repayment for physicians who commit to five years of service. Building on those for a broader program that is for all state employees would be a powerful tool to recruit and retain talented professionals, keep expertise in-house, and strengthen the quality and stability of public service across the state.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-14T23:42:49+0000,0,"[

I timed how long it take to open a Attachments or a plan and it takes 32 seconds, and I open almost 50 documents a day in AWARE. I did the math and that equals 26 minutes  of waiting at the end of the day. That is precious time that I could have met with a participant, but instead I'm waiting for an attachment to open. 

Also, each time they update aware it messes up almost everything, every time. In the last update it make it so I couldn't see SSN or any valuable information and it took weeks to figure it out. 

secondly, I think ""Activity Dues"" (AD) are an awful way to delegate tasks. When changes are made or notes were left on the AD we don't get told at all. We have to remember to go back and check, and with a caseload of 200, that is almost impossible. 

Lastly, The state need to live in reality and realize that people don't want to work/stay at the DOR is because our pay absolutely absurd!! For the amount of work we do, and the amount of situations this job put us in, we are treated and paid like our work doesn't matter. People at the DOR feel like the state of California doesn't care about their civil servants who dedicate their life's to helping the lives of people with disabilities.

If a department has a repair or modification that needs to be done, it must go through DGS and they will do the work themselves, contract out, or very rarely delegate the project back to departments. DGS charges an absurd amount for their overhead and project management costs, and takes several years to complete projects.  For example, our department needed a new HVAC unit that took DGS 4 years to complete and a new roof that took 5.  A private contractor can do this work for pennies on the dollar and in days vs years, saving the state millions.  Why can't DGS delegate some of this work to departments?  They say the government code requires them to do everything, but how long do we need to keep referring to these code sections without considering amendments to streamline government?  My department has had to lay off seasonal staff because DGS' costs kept going up and we couldn't afford to pay for a repair that was taking 3 years and also continue our operations.  And if DGS has vacancies, the work just sits there and doesn't get done until they hire and train more staff.  This is an INCREDIBLE waste of state resources.  Also, take a look at Unit 9's salaries.  The amount it costs to pay DGS for this work is WAY above what the state could be paying a private contractor, even at a prevailing wage.

Rather than go out and have contractors propose solutions without fully understanding the ever-evolving business needs, the state should develop a ""proof of concept"" in house prior to going to RFP. This means developing enough of the tool to see system limitations and get an idea on its overall functionality. This would help develop requirements of the tool as we see shortcomings of what is developed but could also be used as a way to help contractors understand what is being sought out. I would suggest involving program (the internal state teams that would use the tool) early on to ensure the business rules are represented. At the discretion of the State, then we could move to a formal RFP and demo the proof of concept or we could continue development in house.

I know several occasions where decision makers are overstepping their boundary.  Even worse is when low level (say AGPA) is trying to do the best job they can, but don't realize the negative impact they are creating or the laws that they are breaking.  For example, a AGPA needs data from another agency.  They are blanketly ask for the information.  The other agency, doing the best job they can do, says Ok and collects the data. However, collecting that information could have taken 80 hours, or require a ""system"" to be built to accommodate the request.  When looking deeper into ""the information"", it was never required by law to collect the data. This is unnecessary waste.  Times this by 1000's of request, and we're all working for each other, and not the people of CA.

State employees are very hard workers and try their best.  Sometimes, we need to step back and make sure we are doing what we should be doing, and not what we want to do.  This wasteful work leads to wasted time spent, delays in the work that should be done, and selfish pride.

Laws - we all have to abide by them.  However, many laws have ""sunset dates"".  it would be nice if the State of CA did a cross analysis of what policy was created for what law.  if that law was changed, modified, or unsetted, then the policy needs to do the same.

The state has zero regard for this, and each new employee is left to fend for themselves and try to figure out what the person they replaced was doing. This causes a ripple effect with everyone this person works with and creates more work for all involved.

Too often, employees face challenges such as outdated classifications, pay that does not reflect the cost of living, and limited flexibility in how we work.

To solve this, I would advocate for three key improvements: first, expanding telework options where appropriate, since telework has proven to increase productivity, save costs, and improve work–life balance; second, raising pay scales to be more competitive so that we can attract and keep skilled workers; and third, ensuring proper classifications so employees are recognized and compensated for the full scope of their responsibilities.

Sky-high taxes, crushing regulations, and one-party rule have made it hostile to business and middle-class families. Soft-on-crime policies created safe havens for criminals, while homelessness is out of control despite billions spent. The state throws money at symptoms without addressing root causes like addiction and mental illness, and restrictive zoning makes affordable housing impossible. California isn’t broke, it’s just It’s failing because its leaders prioritize woke virtue signaling, radical environmentalism, and identity politics over law, order, affordability, and common sense.

We transitioned to a paperless file system  back in 2006 when the State began requiring reports/data to be submitted and uploaded to the Geotracker database. There are still 100s of existing folders, reports, etc. (one estimate was that our unit's file room contains 1/3 of a mile of paper). Environmental pollution cases are unique: we're required to keep records of all sites, closed or not, in case land use changes in the future (also, it's the law). We routinely have PRA/FOIA requests to pull files for consultant review, and more than 75% of the time they'll ask us to scan and email them.  Our region is also vast- some of these consultants and landowners live 6 hours away from out office, and some have physical handicaps that limit their mobility, so we try to oblige. But actually taking apart a file, scanning it, categorizing it, and uploading it is extremely labor intensive. A small file will take a few hours, but even a medium sized one requires one or two days (the scanning is rapid, uploading and naming is laborious).  SOLUTIONS: 1) hire dedicated admin staff to do this work, 2) subcontract it out to a bonded document scanning service. BENEFITS: 1) Reduced labor costs for professional and admin staff 2) improved public access for these records 3) potential to upload to AI for detailed summation and analysis.

All people hear about are the slow wheels of bureaucracy and government waste, not realizing that the design is purposeful. Obviously there ways to make things more efficient, like digitizing forms, modernizing ways to make payments, etc. However, my experience is that most agencies are working on these issues. Just look at the DMV, or being able to pay a parking ticket on your phone, amazing! However, due to the nature of our work, sometimes it's important to work slowly and methodically, with standard procedures. When we ""move fast and break things"" or suffer from burnout trying to ""optimize"" our workday into hyper-efficiency, those things effect people's lives very deeply and if we can be thoughtful, we can make them better than the original concept. When we do that, it always pays us back, fiscally as well as socially. Because the public is so focused on waste, instead of hiring internally, we hire contractors, and instead of hiring the best contractor, we have to hire the one with the lowest bid. This creates real waste that hurts the tax payers and frustration of employees.

That particular resident gets insulin twice a day, so they were able to acquire all those needles over a period of time. Residents bring their tablet to the pill window and in the clinic. The tablets aren't allowed to leave the housing units for obvious reasons. A patient reported to an exam room to complete their appointment with me this week with a hot cup of coffee. I didn't notice he was holding it until we were in the room together. The porters/residents in our clinic are allowed to ""clean"" without anyone directly watching them. The porters/residents are given access to areas they should never be given entry to.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-26T20:33:45+0000,0,"[

Government bureaucracy is structured in a way that pushes decision-making upward through the chain of command, concentrating authority in the hands of a few. This results in an overabundance of policies and procedures that strip decision-making power from the subject matter experts—the individuals actually performing the hands-on work.

Furthermore, this system fosters a dense layer of middle management that often controls decisions without fully understanding their upstream or downstream impacts. This disconnect between decision-makers and practitioners undermines efficiency and responsiveness.

To truly improve government operations, this overarching management structure must be reformed. Such reform will likely require legislative action to decentralize authority, empower technical experts, and streamline bureaucratic processes.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-26T19:23:55+0000,0,"[

5296,,2fe00722-208e-47c3-b52e-2450a2f466f4,"I would address is the breakdown in communication, specifically how long it takes to report and resolve operational problems. In my experience, communication often functions as a buffer that insulates leadership from the daily realities faced by frontline staff. When issues arise, responses are frequently delayed due to layers of approval, bureaucratic hurdles, or vague assurances that “it’s being looked into.” This delay not only prolongs the problem but can exacerbate it to the point of creating liability or safety risks. Unfortunately, when these issues escalate, leadership may downplay their prior awareness, further eroding trust and morale.

To solve this, I would advocate for a transparent, time-bound communication protocol that includes:

•	A tiered reporting system that tracks issues from initial submission to resolution, with clear accountability at each level.  While some systems are already in place the emphasis should be on ensuring managers cannot minimize their role when issues persist.

•	Mandatory feedback loops where leadership must acknowledge receipt and provide status updates within a set timeframe.

•	Consistent process audits to identify bottlenecks and recurring delays, followed by actionable reforms.

•	And most importantly, a culture shift that values timely action over bureaucratic deflection, recognizing that unresolved issues create stress, inefficiency, and risk for those doing the work.

This should be done while respecting existing labor rights.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-05T17:57:45+0000,0,"[

Here's the vision someone who is qualified for a subsidized electricity rate may also be qualified for CalFresh.

Ideally, it would be good to have a universal crosswalk of IQPs so that if you sign up for one, you are offered access to all of the others at the same time. This might look like a central hub for accessing all social/welfare benefits run by the state where you fill out an initial intake survey (limited to 15 questions *max*) and then have all programs you qualify for presented to you for sign up, in such a way that you can just check a box and batch-enroll in multiple at once.

&gt;&gt;Solution: Extend AGPA Probationary Period to One Year
------------
I recommend we align the probationary period for Associate Governmental Program Analysts (AGPA) with that of Staff Services Analysts (SSA), Staff Services Manager I (SSM1), and most other state classifications. The current 6-month probationary period for AGPA's is insufficient for thorough training and evaluation, particularly for new hires without prior program knowledge and experience. This short period forces managers to make premature decisions about an employee's capabilities, potentially leading to the rejection of individuals who could excel with more time. By increasing the probationary period to one-year, new AGPAs will have adequate time to become proficient in their roles, ensuring fair evaluation and comprehensive training. This change will also expand the hiring pool, allowing managers to confidently consider AGPA candidates, knowing they will have sufficient time to develop necessary skills. The 6-month probationary period should be retained for AGPAs promoted in place, as they already possess relevant experience from their SSA roles in the same program. Extending the AGPA probationary period to one year for new hires would be a win-win for staff and managers.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T21:28:43+0000,0,"[

We’ve also improved our editing and reviewing etiquette. Instead of slowing things down with multiple rounds of small changes, reviewers will often give feedback like, “Next time you do something like this, try it this way,” rather than holding up the current draft for minor points.

In exchange for these investments, companies could simultaneously enjoy tax breaks. This could be in the form of parks, sponsoring improved education programs, donation to public transportation improvements, etc. 

This would act as a mutual benefit to the company and the community, thus allowing reduction of civilian taxation, which would mean greater money able to be injected into the community by civilian spending. 

Tax breaks could even be tiered based on the area and type of community investment(s) made. For example, a company who provided funding for a state-of-the-art housing development for lower-income individuals would receive a different tax break than another company who donates canned goods. Incentives could also be stacked, this way a company could, theoretically SIGNIFICANTLY reduce their taxation by providing extensive contributions to the community. 

I feel like this would make more companies want to move to and stay in California; plus, it could provide a mutually beneficial way to not heavily tax residents while still enabling California communities to flourish.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-26T16:50:11+0000,0,"[

In one agency, management prohibited cross-unit dialogue, slowing progress and isolating teams. In another, annual surveys repeatedly flagged communication as the top issue, yet leadership insisted on injecting themselves in every conversation or discouraging communication with other units and divisions. Instead of seeking answers from the sources, managerial direction has focused on the interpretation of resources that often prove incorrect. These decisions negatively impact morale, cause frustrations in a job that would otherwise feel ideal, and reminds of the axom that people don't quit jobs, they quit managers. 

Managers often lack subject matter expertise, causing delays and confusion. Many openly promote a “fake it till you make it” mindset, prioritizing their own job security over the work required to excel when serving the public.

From a customer’s perspective, the State’s reliance on mailed notices and mailed responses is outdated and inefficient. Californians expect the same level of convenience they experience with banks, healthcare providers, and private businesses. Mailing forms back and forth creates delays, risks lost documents, and forces residents to rely on slower communication when technology could streamline the process.

Proposed Solution:
Require high-volume departments to offer an online option for submitting responses or uploading documents. Provide funding to ensure these systems are secure and user-friendly.

Gives Californians faster, more reliable ways to communicate with the State.

Reduces dependence on paper, manual scanning, and case management bottlenecks.

Aligns government services with modern technology standards and customer expectations.

Problem 2 – Employee Retention and Knowledge Gaps
State programs are highly complex, requiring years of training to master. While it is positive that employees advance through promotions, frequent turnover combined with limited pay results in ongoing knowledge loss and operational disruptions.

As such, there are often multiple wasteful and non-necessary steps both employees and customers are “required” to take before a customer transaction can be completed. We have failed to analyze and update many of these processes using new methodologies, ways of thinking, and tools that are already readily available to us. It has happened on several occasions that when an improvement is introduced it fails to receive the support that is needed for successful implementation because some members of management fear change and/or feel that they cannot devote employee hours to implementation and testing.
I believe systematic and proven process improvement techniques (like Lean Six Sigma, PDCA, Total Quality Management, etc.) performed by state-employed process-improvement specialists that have the support and resources that can be provided by department heads and agency-level management could act to improve inefficient processes across that state.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-25T21:27:14+0000,0,"[

Allowing remote work wherever possible will greatly reduce the amount of money wasted on building leases, maintenance, repairs, electricity, internet, gas, water, office supplies, soap, cleaners, paper towels, toilet paper, etc. Remote work allows for a more diverse workforce and provides opportunity to rural communities throughout the state, mothers, and people with disabilities. It improves productivity by reducing office distractions and stress caused from commuting. For neurodivergent folks working in the office environment can be very stressful and  downright overwhelming. The sounds, smells, lighting, temperature, masking, etc. impact the ability to focus leading to more mistakes, work being done slower, burnout, etc. Not to mention all the physical, mental, emotional, and personal issues caused by the stress of it all. It reduces carbon emissions, vehicle miles traveled, traffic congestion, and safety risks by having fewer people on the road, thus reducing funds spent on responding to crashes. It improves employee morale by allowing time that would be spent commuting to be spent with family, friends, etc. Shifting to the electronic/virtual world wherever possible will speed up processing times across the board.

5829,3671,866f03bc-de42-4777-8a92-89ca5fdb041f,"I think one of the challenges that many departments face is a lack of staffing resources to provide this kind of support. Throughout the past 25 years of my state career, I have experienced several furloughs, and more hiring freezes and position sweeps than I'd care to remember.  Over the years, staffing resources have eroded away to the point that there is just enough support to keep the lights on. With each of these cuts, we lose capacity for the true in-depth training and development that is called for commensurate with the positions. This, coupled with being constantly asked to do more with less, means that many of our staff are hired and ""thrown into the deep end"". It is extremely difficult to get more resources to replace those lost to position sweeps/etc. In fact, many departments have even lost sight of some of the things that they 'used to do' because they have not been staffed for so long. This becomes a vicious cycle, as people get frustrated with the amount of workload and lack of training. 

There has also been a noticeable gap in management training. Yes, it is required. However often times new managers start and are immediately thrown into fighting fires. The trainings turn into an inconvenience resulting in feeling even more overworked trying to make up for the time lost, rather than a respite to focus on growth and development for this exciting new career step.

This approach could also pave the way for a vocational rehabilitation program for inmates, teaching ranching skills. A viable skill to make money and raise meat for your family. Some of the benefits:
1. Reduced Operating Costs:
Using animals to manage vegetation eliminates need for fuel, equip maintenance, & groundskeeper's salary.
2. Environmental Sustainability:
Goats & sheep provide a natural, eco-friendly alternative to mowing, reducing reliance on fossil fuels & machinery.
3. Community Engagement:
Partnering with 4-H or FFA youth groups provides a valuable community outreach opportunity & educational experience.
4. Inmate Rehabilitation:
A successful pilot program could lead to development of a ranching rehabilitation program, offering incarcerated individuals marketable skills & a potential path to employment upon release.
5. Fire Hazard Reduction:
Regular grazing by livestock can help reduce build-up of dry vegetation, a fire hazard, especially in California's climate. 
6. Security:

This forensic review process and account reconciliation would seem to be waste of State resources if the commuter is going to continue to use the same public transportation each month. The suggestion is to bring the voucher system back. If the cost of a monthly transportation pass increases (which is infrequent) then the voucher amount would increase accordingly. Surely that would be less costly than CalAters reviewing every individual commuter's request for reimbursement every month by the accounting team.,Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-18T20:55:46+0000,4,"[

In my own work, I have streamlined processes that once depended on paper files, in-person signatures, or lengthy office meetings. By shifting these tasks online and coordinating virtually, I eliminated delays and reduced errors that came from moving documents between offices. This allowed staff to focus more on completing core work instead of chasing paperwork, which directly improved turnaround times for the public.

Another example is customer service. When working remotely, I am able to respond more quickly to inquiries because I am not losing hours each week to commuting. I can give residents my full attention without the stress and fatigue of traffic, which means they get clearer answers and faster resolutions. Many constituents rely on timely help, and telework enables me to deliver that without sacrificing quality.

Telework also fosters accountability. Using shared databases, secure online platforms, and video calls, collaboration with colleagues remains strong. In fact, it often becomes more intentional and focused. The ability to concentrate without the constant interruptions of an office environment has increased my productivity and accuracy.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-08-22T23:33:45+0000,0,"[

6151,,1c60f573-778c-40b9-8b3a-9c91473e512d,"Primary Problem:
When state departments restructure teams or redistribute workloads without hiring additional staff, employees are often left managing the same amount, or more work, with fewer people. This creates burnout, inefficiency, and errors. Team members begin to feel like they’re constantly behind, unable to meet expectations, and working reactively instead of proactively. Over time, this erodes morale and productivity, leading to higher turnover and lost institutional knowledge. 

Before any team restructuring, require a Workload Impact Assessment from management to evaluate how the redistribution of tasks will affect timelines, quality of work, productivity, and employee well-being. This should include clear metrics such as workload ratios, task priorities, and realistic turnaround times and involve direct input from the staff who understand the day-to-day demands. Departments should also implement temporary workload support plans, and training managers how to support their team when they are taking on a doubled workload. 

By assessing impact before implementing a big change like that, California can prevent inefficiencies caused by chronic overload, promote employee well-being and reduce the likelihood of good employees leaving, and ensure high-quality service delivery even during tough transitions.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-20T20:25:51+0000,0,"[

Sales and use tax regulations are complex and often contain gray areas. True expertise usually comes from auditors who have dealt with specific, real-world applications of the law. However, there is no easy or safe way for auditors to share their knowledge across the department. Getting clarity on how to apply a regulation often requires layers of approvals, and managers may hesitate to elevate questions up the chain. This slows audits, wastes staff hours, and delays clear guidance to taxpayers.

Proposed Idea
Create a safe, department-wide collaboration channel where auditors can directly share and discuss regulation questions with a large group of experienced peers. For example, an internal email group or moderated forum could allow auditors to submit questions and receive input quickly, without having to navigate multiple levels of approval. Faster feedback would reduce audit hours, improve consistency, and give taxpayers clearer answers sooner, all while fostering a culture of shared expertise and professional growth.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-26T22:07:16+0000,0,"[

We have fewer instances of process documentation and very little consistent messaging around project processes and procedures. This is sometimes passed off as ""nuance"" between projects but the procedures should be largely the same for substantively similar tasks and no task is so nuanced that it can not be documented for the staff working on a specific project. Training is often one person showing another with no supervisor oversight or written documentation, so failures in a process persist through generations of staff. Some processes are intentionally obscured to mask waste or inefficiency, where they could and should be transparent and streamlined. Much of our technology was established in the 1990s and has never been updated or improved, despite being obsolete. Tech staff retention needs to be addressed and change management for technology needs to be better handled. Rank and file staff needs to be empowered to learn and understand technology.

It’s frustrating to work alongside individuals who consistently underperform or show little motivation, especially when dedicated employees like myself are paid the same or often less. This impacts morale, slows progress, and weakens the overall effectiveness of the team.

To address this, I’d advocate for a more meaningful and transparent performance evaluation process that includes peer feedback and self-assessments, not just supervisor input. Raises and promotions should reflect both tenure and performance, so that strong employees feel valued and motivated. I’d also propose a peer recognition program to highlight those who go above and beyond, and development plans for employees who need improvement. Finally, training supervisors to actively manage performance issues would help ensure accountability.

These changes would support a healthier workplace culture and better public service. By recognizing effort and addressing complacency, we can build teams that truly reflect the values of public service.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-04T20:16:30+0000,0,"[

Some corporations illegally or inappropriately received PPP loans based on the honor system and took PPP loan deductions in their returns.  If the FTB shared this misrepresentation found during routine audits with other agencies such as SBA to enforce those (i.e. large and publicly traded corporations) that inappropriately received funds, the State of CA would be able revive the income.  When CA funds are inappropriately used to fund profitable corporations during the panddemic such as PPP loans and online criminals continuously stealing money from the State of CA's IT systems, more law enforcement is needed to avoid the illegal loss of funds .  Rather than cutting state salaries, budget cuts, and other reductions that harm the State of CA and our taxpayers, we should pursue the large corporations and criminals that illegally received the funds in the first place.  Placing more security on our IT systems is crucial for protecting our taxpayer funds from continual hacking and misappropriation of funds.

In my agency, cronyism, nepotism and favoritism run rampant. The rules speak out against these practices, but it seems that the system has slowly evolved to where it is not designed to encourage them.

One of the reasons this happens if SPB has a rule that examination results are kept private, so there is no way to know the exam results of others who have taken the same exam, and it becomes extremely difficult to prove when others rig and/or cheat the system.

Another reason is the heavy reliance on job references, which seem to these days be more important than actual work experience and meeting job qualifications.

Get a hold of all of the dishonesty and restore actual merit in the merit system and you will have better, more qualified, reliable, knowledgeable and more efficient state employees.

It would be faster for departments if they could just do it themselves, and DGS would still have oversight since they would need to execute the PO.

First, there are extremely limited resources available to applicants to help them navigate a hiring process that is fundamentally different from most others.

This is a major impediment to hiring equity. Second, the almost cartoonishly strict interpretation of MQs regularly disqualifies intensely qualified applicants. The staff responsible for interpreting MQs are not experts in the fields they are judging and frequently discredit intensely relevant work experience simply due to the use of a synonym; I have seen applicants with decades of relevant experience have it all thrown out for using a slightly different word on their applicant than what the exam/application reviewer was looking for.

It is my understanding that Directors and Deputy Directors may not go through HR & that reference checks are not always conducted. If that is the case, I believe reference checks should be required for all candidates. Additionally, I believe the current scoring process could be improved. In some cases, employees with many years of service in a department are not selected, which can be very discouraging. I suggest eliminating the scoring system and limiting interview panels to no more than two members to help ensure fairness and consistency.
2. Supervisor Evaluation
For employees who are not in supervisory roles, I recommend implementing a survey every six months to provide feedback on their supervisor. These evaluations could be reviewed by the CEA to help identify areas of improvement. I have observed that not all individuals in supervisory positions possess the people skills necessary for effective leadership, and this type of feedback could support their professional development.
3. Open Communication and Feedback
All employees, regardless of level, should feel comfortable sharing ideas or raising concerns about their department without fear of retaliation. To strengthen accountability, departments should provide feedback within five business days of receiving employee input. Too often, employees are told that leadership will “get back to them,” but no follow-up occurs.

The current infrastructure is antiquated (over 40 years old and is DOS), and because so many departments and individuals are involved in each process, with systems that don’t communicate with each other, it often creates delays and confusion. Even when tasks are completed promptly on our end, we’re left waiting for other departments to act, which can negatively impact the employees we serve. I'm speaking from within Human Resources. 

I understand that there are efforts underway to create a new system, but past attempts have fallen short due to the complexity of the project. Training has also been limited to overly basic scenarios, leaving staff unprepared for real-world complications. When unique or difficult cases arise, there’s often no clear guidance or consistent answers.

To address this, I believe we need:

A centralized and integrated system that reduces dependency on multiple platforms.

Collaborative development of the system with feedback from front-line users during the build phase, not just after rollout.

Advanced scenario-based training that includes real-life, complex examples.

A dedicated support team that can provide timely and consistent answers when issues arise.

Workshops aimed at raising awareness

Being able to appropriately convey expectations in an efficient and effective manner is a challenge that I think we can all relate to in some aspect. Whether this means streamlining systems or revisiting process steps, I've long felt the impact of circuitous actions which, especially in repetitive tasks, limit the potential for more meaningful task completion, learning, and even have negative impact on employee engagement and morale. 

Proper education in evolving with technology and developing less complicated means to accomplish required tasks enables big changes to be handled in a more incremental manner, which, in turn, allows more adequate training and mitigates the inherent aversion to change by offering what appears more like help, rather than a potentially overwhelming or burdensome addition/change to one's workload or processes.

This ultimately improves job satisfaction, thus improving morale and even reducing costs as work completion times not only reduce, but the ease and desire for employees to complete more work increases.

As a relatively new employee to the State, I’ve observed some concerning disparities in management oversight across departments. While I understand that some areas utilize tools like 360-degree reviews and engagement surveys to support accountability and continuous improvement, this is not the case in my department.

It is disheartening to witness talented and dedicated employees become disengaged or leave entirely due to unaddressed management issues. There appears to be no formal mechanism for providing feedback on managerial performance—no 360 reviews, no engagement or pulse surveys, and no exit interviews. As a result, problematic management behaviors often go unchecked, with no accountability or opportunity for constructive feedback.

The high turnover in the department should serve as a clear signal that something is amiss. Without systems in place to evaluate and improve leadership practices, managers are able to operate without oversight, while employees are left vulnerable. Since managers control performance evaluations and career progression, employees are placed in a difficult position where they may feel unable to speak up without fear of retaliation.

Introducing even basic feedback systems would be a meaningful step toward a healthier and more effective workplace culture.

The ""cutting the green tape"" initiative was good, but didn't really fix structural issues. For example, replacing a minor culvert under a remote road in the middle of summer when it's bone dry still costs $10,000 in labor before ground is even broken. Surely there could be a streamlined (no pun intended) process for this-- perhaps a straightforward checklist or rubric to determine if there are major concerns or perhaps statutory exemptions for which you qualify. 
2) Basic tasks like purchasing and timesheets are so complicated that we literally need a TEAM of administrative staff to handle navigating the esoteric, bureaucratic backwaters of Sacramento. Even with their help, it's frustrating, time-consuming, and hilariously dysfunctional. This is don't have solutions for. Ours is a large and complicated state.

The return-to-office mandate has created challenges for many employees—particularly those hired into remote roles. While some employees value in-office collaboration (myself included), requiring relocation to a specific office location is impractical and disruptive for many. Many people were hired for remote positions and are now facing the option to move to the specific location of their state office or find a new job. However, in many cases, employees live near a state office, just not the one affiliated with their agency. Forcing them to move or resign creates unnecessary turnover and hardship. Further, many offices that are designated for a specific agency/department are sitting mostly vacant because they have hired staff all over the state for remote work that do not live near their specific office. Therefore, state employees should be allowed to choose an office to work from, rather than office space being designated only for one agency/department. Providing more flexibility in where state employees can work solves problems for the employees who would like to work near where they live and solves problems for the state by filling currently vacant office space. 

Side benefits would occur from this change by introducing state employees that would otherwise not meet, breaking down silos, and creating community based on location.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-15T23:25:18+0000,0,"[

From my perspective, telework directly addresses the two goals of this discussion: increasing efficiency within state government and improving service to the public.

When state employees telework, we eliminate hours of commuting time each week. That reclaimed time translates into more energy and focus for our work, rather than starting the day already drained from traffic. Telework also reduces overhead costs for departments, with less need for office space, utilities, and parking reimbursements. Those savings could be redirected toward technology, staffing, or public programs that improve government services.

Telework allows employees to be more responsive to the public.

The Ford Lightning electric truck can take up to 14 hours to charge, so while it's charging we're either down a vehicle and that workload or we have to force other staff in a gas truck to double-up on their route and we need to pay them overtime. The First Purchasing Mandate says that we can request an exemption from an EV from DGS once we meet our 50% mandate, but DGS says they're being pushed to put more state EVs on the road because of the Governor's executive order so they deny the exemption requests.  What are departments supposed to do?  Pay their staff overtime to do the work a person in an EV can't?  Pay for a hotel and meals when field staff are stranded because they can't charge their vehicle?  Rent short-term rentals to try and offset the downtime with EVs?  None of this is efficient, and it costs double.  Also, has anyone done an analysis on the cost of an EV vs the cost of a gas vehicle?  Usually about 2-3 times as expensive for an EV when departments are also facing budget reductions. This seems like such a waste of taxpayer money, to make government more inefficient and more expensive so citizens pay more and get less.

I understand the need for DGS to review and scrutinize additional fleet assets, but why are replacement vehicles so difficult to obtain?  It takes DGS 3-4 months just to approve the purchase (and DGS recently said departments will need to submit their Fleet Acquisition Plans 60 days sooner than in the past), and then once a vehicle is identified departments find out DGS has updated the state contract and the replacement vehicle is no longer even available.  From the time a department submits a Fleet Acquisition Plan (April 1), DGS approves by June 30, and then it often takes at least until December or January for the vehicle to arrive.  So if a vehicle is broken down, a department knows it's going to take at least 9 months to get that vehicle replaced and they need to rent a vehicle in the meantime.  DGS only allows short-term rentals for up to 30 days, anything longer tmust also be submitted to DGS for approval. The long-term rental process for DGS, even in these instances, results in tons of justification and back-and-forth between DGS and departments and in the meantime work cannot be completed or staff with a vehicle must do double the work to make up for the vehicle shortfall.

Recruitment and retention have become real challenges across departments. Telework and statewide hiring in the early 2020s helped bring in skilled professionals from every region, but with pay falling behind the private sector, limited advancement opportunities, and new in-office requirements, we’ve lost experienced employees who carried years of institutional knowledge. Replacing them, if we can, is costly and slow, and the impact is felt directly by Californians through slower services and reduced program quality.

A sustainable solution would be a statewide Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP) for state employees. CA already uses LRAP models successfully for legal aid attorneys and physicians serving Medi-Cal patients. Expanding them to all state employees would help recruit and retain talented professionals, keep expertise in-house, and strengthen the delivery of public services, like environmental protection, health care, and consumer rights, that Californians rely on every day.

Student loan debt affects more than 3.8 million Californians. I’ve seen colleagues delay buying homes, starting families, and saving for the future because their loan payments consume such a large portion of their income. Creating a statewide LRAP would not only help employees build stability and remain in public service, but it would strengthen the economic and social fabric of our communities.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-10-14T23:43:25+0000,1,"[

This isn’t about micromanagement, it's about setting clear expectations, assigning tasks with due dates, tracking progress and holding staff accountable. Instead, agencies often hire expensive project managers, funded by taxpayer dollars, to direct the work. So what, then, is the role of the actual manager? Too often, it’s limited to signing off on timesheets, completing IDPs, attending conferences, and to often encourage staff to “get the work done when they can”, so 2-weeks later or never. 

In my experience, when managers don’t establish timelines or hold staff accountable, tasks take significantly longer to complete. Project managers, on the other hand, drive progress and lead teams to results more efficiently than many state managers.

This has been caused by at least 2 different things: 1) RTO policies and refusing to listen to state employees; 2) poor management and bad leadership that results in inefficient or unfair division of labor. Leadership, starting at the very top, needs to respect and listen to state workers. When policies, like RTO, are implemented without any real consideration of how it will upend the lives of civil servants--that is disrespectful and will always lead to low morale. I have also seen morale be impacted by poor leadership and bad supervisors (i.e. ones that do not listen to their employees and refuse to pivot when needed, or just flat out assign work unfairly). Once morale is low, people will begin doing the ""bare minimum.""  They will take very little pride in their work. They will not care about outcomes. They will be so stressed and they will lose their focus at work. This is what leads to inefficiency. When you have workers who are able to pay their bills comfortably (because they are receiving a fair wage), when they see management take on the hard tasks (because management is making more money and should be taking on the more challenging projects), when they are allowed to work in places of safety and comfort (such as their own homes where they are mostly shielded from inappropriate conduct such as workplace violence, racist or sexist comments, physical-micro-management, etc.), that is what will improve efficiency for all!!",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-20T17:52:14+0000,0,"[

We spend so much time on checks, reporting, and auditing that sometimes the work of actually serving people drifts further and further away.

One solution I’d like to see is the idea of “bottleneck detectives.” These would be small cross-functional teams—made up of staff who know the programs inside and out—tasked with finding the points where work slows down unnecessarily. Twice a year, they would sit down with their teams, map out processes, and identify steps that don’t add value. If a new check or reporting requirement is added, an old one has to be removed. The detectives would track and report back on what’s been eliminated, making sure accountability is preserved without building endless new layers.

Problem: Government services are designed inside-out, around agency processes rather than citizen needs. This leads to frustration, inefficiency, and loss of trust.
Recommendation: Apply an outside-in design approach, mapping services around resident life events.
Build direct feedback loops and co-design opportunities with citizens.
Publish transparent performance dashboards focused on wait times, ease of use, and satisfaction.
Ensure digital equity — designing services for all Californians, not just the tech-savvy.
Impact: A government that is more human-centered, responsive, and trusted.
2. Modernize Laws and Require Continuous Improvement
Problem: Laws and policies that govern service delivery are rigid, outdated, and typically reformed only after years of failure. Projects often stop evolving once deployed, locking in inefficiency.
Recommendation: Require statutory/regulatory review on a recurring cycle to keep policies modern.
Build agility clauses into law to allow agencies to update service models without full legislative resets. Mandate that all projects include a continuous improvement plan — with metrics, scheduled updates, and citizen feedback integration. Tie agency funding and leadership performance reviews to progress in modernizing both policies and services.
Impact: Government laws, policies, and systems that evolve continuously with technology and citizen expectations — ensuring services stay relevant & effective","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-30T22:55:29+0000,0,"[

Currently, departments solve similar problems other departments are solving or have already solved in isolation, resulting in inefficient and redundant workstreams. The digital service delivery is fragmented and inefficient, also contributing to a confusing and frustrating experience for Californians. 

To solve this, I would propose the following:

1. Mandate Inter-departmental Collaboration: The state should create a framework that incentivizes and, where necessary, requires departments and agencies to collaborate on key initiatives. This could involve creating a statewide playbook and process that all digital service projects align and follow with a central oversight. 

2. Standardize Technology and Data: We need to break down the technical barriers that prevent departments from working together. A statewide mandate should be put in place to standardize technology platforms and data-sharing protocols. For instance, all digital services should use a common API frameworks and be inter-operable. This would allow different agencies to easily share information, integrate services, and build a more seamless, user-friendly experience for the public.

By implementing these changes, we can move from a system of isolated, inefficient solutions to a collaborative, and cohesive government that is truly focused on better serving the people of California.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-18T21:18:01+0000,20,"[

Local Health Jurisdictions (LHJs) rely heavily on grant money allocated by the CDC or the State. Most of these grants appear to be formula-based, while some are competitive. Problems:
1. Funding public health by grants is not sustainable due to factors such as the end of grants and new policies.
2. Allocations are based on factors that don't accurately represent the real needs of each LHJ.
3. LHJs are not usually part of the decision-making process on how to allocate funds to address the diverse and unique needs of LHJs.
4. Strict guidelines on usage, limits the ability of LHJs to address the specific needs of their LHJ creatively.
5. Not all LHJs possess the skillset and resources to compete fairly for competitive grants distributed by the CDC or CDPH.
Proposed solutions include:
1. Updating allocation methodologies with modern economic models that incorporate factors representing real needs and adjusting for population variations.
2. Making the process participatory, allowing LHJs to contribute to the construction of formulas and the utilization of funds.
3. Building local capacity to secure merit-based grants.

5599,,b8cab3c5-fbdb-43d2-a30f-7ef05401b0b7,"Big Idea: Streamlining Student Internships at State Agencies

Right now, if a college student in California—say, someone attending CSU Fullerton—wants to do an academic internship at a state agency like California State Parks, they face a long and complicated process. Their university has to negotiate a legal agreement (a MOU) with the agency, often involving lawyers on both sides. This process can take months and discourages students and agencies from even trying.

My proposal: The Department of General Services (DGS) should create a blanket MOU that covers academic internships between all California public college systems (Community Colleges, CSU, and UC) and all state agencies. This would eliminate the need for each university and agency to negotiate separate legal agreements every time a student wants to intern.

Agencies would still define the details of each internship—like duties, schedules, and supervision—but the legal framework would already be in place.

This would:
- Make it easier for students to gain hands-on experience in public service.
- Reduce administrative burden for both colleges and agencies.
- Create a clear recruitment pathway for state agencies to identify and develop future talent.
- Expose students to careers in public service, helping build a stronger, more diverse pipeline into government work.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-26T19:31:47+0000,0,"[

The first thing I would do is get rid of or upgrade the two outdated Call Report forms we utilize and condense it to only one upgraded Call Report form that can be downloaded from NMLS and uploaded to our MTFD database. Before the transition to NMLS ( Nationwide Multistate Licensing System & Registry), the licensee was only required to submit one Call Report form. This form was powered by Microsoft Excel with macros built in.  The form was very glitchy and required the licensee to make multiple submissions at times when the wrong button was selected or the form was saved improperly. Now, the licensee must submit two Call Reports, one in an Excel format and the other using the NMLS format. The NMLS Call Report no longer has the built in error checking or data validation of the original Call Report. So now examiners have to waste time having the licensee correct and resubmit Call Reports for minor housekeeping issues. For example, the Outstanding Transmission Liability should agree on both the Balance Sheet Page and Permissible Investment Page. In the past, the Call Report could not be saved or submitted until the corresponding amounts are in agreement. Further, the NMLS Call Report should be updated to reflect both year to date balances and quarter-to-date balances.

4509,,45f968a2-cb9e-496d-bc53-2773cf72cdf3,"My perspective as a California resident is that while we have a complex state for water resources, but we are confused about priorities because of the push and pulls of leadership. The degrees of separation from staff to leadership continue to create large gaps in efficiencies and agile communication. Young innovative professionals often are left without a platform to grow and further develop innovative qualities. 
Meanwhile, staff are promoted in place to management without the necessary qualities of good leadership resulting in cultural inconsistencies from agency to agency, even from branch to branch. Additionally, little to no recourse for nonviolent conflict resolution works because of these cultural inconsistencies, and as a result, I see regular struggle between staff, middle management, and HR with supporting the state's mission, vision, and values. 
Leading by transparency is the way to remain a leader in these new technological age, and I do hope that the changes necessary may still lie ahead.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-21T23:47:54+0000,0,"[

Even within the same department, different offices often perform the same tasks in completely different ways. This creates confusion, inconsistent training, and inefficiencies. There is also a widespread lack of clear and accessible documentation for processes and procedures. Without it, onboarding is more difficult, and new employees spend unnecessary time trying to figure out how to complete routine tasks.

There is also very little collaboration or sharing of knowledge between departments. When I have reached out for guidance or documentation, I rarely receive a response, and when I do, it is often not useful. It can feel like departments are operating in silos, keeping information to themselves instead of working together. I think focusing on standardizing processes and building a more open, collaborative culture would significantly improve how effectively we function as a state.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-19T15:44:31+0000,8,"[

These problems are the the lack of standardized training, and that the allocated number of job positions do not scale based on each office's workload. The number of staff available to give effective training is impacted by the face that the number of staff in each office within the same department, branch, and division is not scaled for the workload within their respective jurisdictions. For example, every office has the same number of AGPAs and PT IIs while 35% of the offices had at least double the workload within their respective jurisdictions than the rest of the offices. Unbalanced workloads between two locations will lead to the loss in retention of staff. This eventually will require training for new staff that replace those employees that leave a busier office. When there isn't standardized training each employee, and office, will come up with processes that may be incorrect. Eventually an audit may be completed and the staff in the office find out after the audit that they were incorrectly trained and things have been processed incorrectly. Some of the shortcuts in processes occur because there is a lack of staff, which ties back to the issue of job positions not scaling based on workload.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-24T19:01:02+0000,0,"[

Extensive research has shown that cutting Medicaid coverage leads to worse health and increased risk of premature mortality. As a possible solution, the State of California could implement corresponding state-level tax increases to partially backfill federal safety net cuts. Since some of these cuts won’t take effect for a couple of years, there is the possibility that the control of the House and Senate could change in 2026, and then legislation could be passed to undue some of the federal cuts to Medicaid.

Leaders seem to focus on blame, micromanagement, and unclear expectations rather than encouragement, collaboration, and clear communication. It feels as though i'm working in my parent's and grandparent's generation. This has created an environment where employees feel disempowered, disconnected, and hesitant to share ideas or challenge the status quo. 

To build a more effective and modern workforce, I think California should invest heavily in leadership development and hold leaders accountable for fostering a supportive, transparent, and progressive culture. Leaders should be given the tools to lead the same virtually as they do in-person. Leaders need to be trained to authentically care about their team members, communicate virtually or in-person with kindness and respect, and engage with employees in a way that feels human and positive, rather than robotic and forced. With new generations entering the workforce, leadership needs to adapt to meet evolving workplace expectations.

The Plain Language Initiative aims to make California government communications clear, accessible, and equitable. Too often, state forms, letters, and websites are filled with jargon and legalese that create confusion and barriers. By adopting plain-language standards, we can help Californians understand information the first time, reduce duplicate inquiries, and build stronger trust in government.

In the first nine months, the initiative would apply to high-volume documents such as forms, notices, FAQs, and websites, piloted in key agencies like DMV, HR, and EDD. Deliverables include a Plain Language Style Guide, staff training modules, rewritten sample documents, and a feedback dashboard to track resident experience.

Key objectives are to improve readability to an 8th-grade level or below, train 500+ employees, reduce duplicate public inquiries by 10–15%, and boost satisfaction scores by 15% within a year. With a modest budget of about $250K and existing staff expertise, this project is small enough to implement quickly but large enough to show measurable impact.

This initiative directly supports Governor Newsom’s priorities to modernize government, increase equity, and improve service delivery—demonstrating that clearer communication leads to better outcomes for Californians.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-27T17:55:54+0000,0,"[

Other BDOs operate similar types of databases. 

The state should strongly consider a system to compare the applicable numeric values in the self-reports against the regulatory thresholds. Automatic notices could be issued to the permittee or a report could be generated and provided to the enforcement unit of each BDO.

Here are a few ways a chatbot could assist state department:

Handling Routine Inquiries: A chatbot can answer frequently asked questions, provide information about licensing processes, and guide users through common procedures. This can free up staff to focus on more complex tasks.

Collecting Feedback: Implementing a chatbot to gather feedback from stakeholders can help identify areas for improvement. The chatbot can ask specific questions and compile responses for analysis.

Scheduling and Reminders: A chatbot can help schedule appointments, send reminders, and provide updates on application statuses. This can improve communication and reduce missed appointments or deadlines.

Providing Resources: The chatbot can direct users to relevant resources, forms, and documents, making it easier for them to find what they need without having to navigate through multiple web pages.

5600,3761,b8cab3c5-fbdb-43d2-a30f-7ef05401b0b7,"Reimagining Recruitment for Analyst Roles

The current recruitment process for analyst positions across state agencies is inefficient and outdated. Most new applicants just want to work for the State—they’re not necessarily tied to a specific department. Yet, they’re forced to apply separately to dozens of similar positions across different agencies, which wastes time and creates unnecessary competition between departments for the same talent.

Here’s a better approach: consolidate analyst hiring into a general pool. The State could recruit analyst generalists centrally, then place them at agencies based on need, fit, and interest. This would streamline hiring, reduce duplication, and help agencies fill roles faster with qualified candidates.

It’s time to rethink recruitment as a statewide strategy, not a department-by-department scramble.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-26T19:32:17+0000,1,,

Currently state buildings are given an allotment that is the same year after year. The allotment is not calculated by taking any factors into consideration like inflation, rising interest rates, cost of living increases. 
The process has slowly driven state buildings into the ground. Old carpet, failing and obsolete building systems all adding up to energy waste and pollution.  
If you owned a home and rented it to the same tenant for 25 years and put 2% of the rent back into the property in that time, what would it look like? Not good is the answer. 
Currently DGS only puts back 2% into state buildings! That number needs to be 10% annually or more on older assets.  Convicted slum lords in California hover around 5% reinvestment and are put into Receivership Court by their banks. We can do better!
Currently DGS takes 98% of the rental income and spends it on unrelated programs. 
The buildings should get the funding they need before the landlord takes the revenue to spend on other things. The income from a building should first cover its expenses before a landlord takes profits. The practice of a property manager spending the rental income of an asset on other things is called Comingling of Funds. it is illegal and the cause of run-down slums.

Each station procures its own PPE, hoses, tools, and follows local policies—resulting in a fragmented system with no standardization or unified effectiveness.

While CDCR Fire Stations at correctional institutions primarily serve an educational mission, that role should not diminish their potential to be a valuable resource for the State of California during emergencies

With proper structure, CDCR Fire could become a valuable asset in California’s wildfire, flood and disaster response efforts. Instead, its lack of coordination makes it a liability.

A centralized command starting in Sacramento is essential. Appointing a Fire Chief and Deputy Chief, supported by three Division Chiefs (North, Central, South), would create statewide oversight. Each fire station would have a Battalion Chief supervising Fire Captains, ensuring consistency and accountability.

This structure would allow Division Chiefs to standardize regional operations and report directly to Sacramento. It would also enable smarter use of state funds, prioritizing purchases based on verified needs. Battalion Chiefs would conduct assessments, Division Chiefs would review them, and Sacramento leadership would allocate resources accordingly.

If modeled after CAL FIRE, CDCR Fire could evolve into a highly effective emergency response force—ready, reliable, and unified.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-26T19:23:55+0000,0,"[

When I was first hired the agency in work for only focused on onboarding for one group of staff and not the staff that support our agency mission, today it is better with more training focusing on onboarding and training for all classifications within the agency. 

Looking at current practices for onboarding and training is the first step to improving how an agency moves forward to training and retain employees. Training departments also need to understand the importance of surveys/evaluations in their training to get real feedback on how they are doing with their training. However, surveys are no good if a department/agency does not have someone to look at the data and bring forth the results of the survey. 

The second step is to have good documentation of current and past processes used within the agency or department.  I have found the lack of documentation waste time and does not allow improvement to easily happen. Understand that people leave and how they do there job is important for the next person who will continue that role within the department.

The original system was cumbersome, with applicants often getting stuck in multi-page forms and unclear instructions. I collaborated with a cross-functional team to redesign the digital interface, reducing the number of steps and integrating real-time error checks. This not only improved the speed of processing but also significantly reduced the number of incomplete applications, helping Californians get the support they needed faster.

Another initiative I want focused on is improving customer service through technology. Recognizing the strain on call centers, I helped implement an AI-powered virtual assistant that could handle frequently asked questions, guide users through common tasks, and escalate complex issues to live agents with full context. This reduced call volume and wait times, allowing staff to focus on urgent cases while citizens received quicker, more accurate support.

I also would like a spearheaded a pilot program to digitize paper-based workflows for applications. By introducing secure e-tools (ChatGpt for customers) and cloud-based document sharing, we cut processing time from weeks to days.

3750,,ebf3eec2-b5aa-4e74-9249-263cf873bc8d,"Problem:
Managers are overextended and lack the capacity to coach and guide their teams effectively.

Why this happens:

-High performers are often promoted to management based on individual success, not leadership ability.

-Many managers have never received ongoing coaching (distinct from one-time training), so they may be unaware of their gaps or the impact on their teams.

-People don’t know what they don’t know, so they’re unlikely to seek out coaching on their own.

Solution:
Provide ongoing coaching for managers, including peer-to-peer formats. This isn’t about formal training programs, but rather open, topic-driven dialogue. For example, live forums could focus on a key topic, with breakout groups (2–4 people) every 10–15 minutes to discuss real-world scenarios and share solutions. CalSTRS does something similar once per quarter for their managers, so that might be a template to start from in other agencies. It's not required, but I think that's a misstep.

Why it matters:
When managers receive consistent coaching, they’re better equipped to guide their teams, set clear expectations, and connect individual work to broader goals, ultimately improving team morale and efficiency over time.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-18T20:24:10+0000,7,"[

A goal for one agency maybe in direct conflict with another agencies goal.  There are countless examples of this.  Especially when it comes to Environmental.  We (the taxpayers) want a healthy environment, but at what cost?  We (the State Employee) want to do the best we can.  However, typically, low level employees are creating processes that increase regulations, aren't customer friendly, and drive-up cost for everyone.  They are not looking at the consequences of their decisions.

In State government, ""everyone has a boss"".  Just because we have Directors and other leadership with a goal, doesn't mean they have the authority to dictate regulations.  Many of them make decisions on experience and ""the way it's always been done"", and that's wrong.  They need to check the big picture.  Sometimes decision makers require unnecessary actions and these cause issues for others.

A great example are Governing boards, such as ARB.  They have good intentions of cleaner air for CA, but at what cost?  Should CA pay $10/gal when the rest of the world is creating global warming.  We are not the problem.  It seems like CA always has to lead.  It would be fine if the taxpayers voted on those regulations, but not when decisions are made by unelected officials.

If certain behaviors are not appropriate, then reprimand the wrong doers. It is mentally draining to have to repeatedly do the online trainings when I wouldn't have been doing it without the training, reprimand the wrong doers.
2. There should be an easy way for employees to submit anonymous commits to their supervisors and managers for change.
3. Make it a priority for the State to pay their bills. There is no reason why businesses should go months and months, maybe even longer, without being paid. We as people can't get away without paying our taxes.
4. How about a large pay cut for those responsible for the budget? If we don't do our job we get reprimanded. But if the budget does work out, we get pay cuts.
5. Make the roads better. Stop making traffic lanes for the rich.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-03T16:42:02+0000,0,"[

Since then, I've been able to implement positive changes that have strengthened our operations. One of the first steps was addressing the organization. I created a RACI Matrix and lists that easily track all that my team has going on. We now have SOPs for each project and staff update them regularly, which ensures consistency and accountability. I also prioritized cleaning up of outdated files, archiving older versions so the most current documents are always easy to find--nothing is deleted, just properly stored. This has made our system streamlined and accessible. I've also modeled simplicity and clarity. I encourage staff to think not only about making their tasks easier for managers, but also about how our work impacts our internal and external partners. That means avoid unnecessary complexity--do not force people to open multiple attachments or links, we summarize key information and provide references as necessary. Our department now feels like a well-run ship because I consistently listen to concerns, take notes, pay close attention to details and operate with a growth mindset that is always focused on continuous quality improvement. Much of my early work felt like cleaning up messes, but through the foundation, it allowed for more strategic planning.

I also believe the state would benefit greatly from further standardization of web/software design and a collaborative community of engineers. (e.g. having templates for commonly needed software, like procurement, inventory, appointment scheduling, marketing/newsletter, learning management, certification tracking, mobile apps, etc.) Agencies could then customize templates to fit their unique needs. This could make software more accessible and affordable, encourage development of the state IT workforce, reduce reliance on private sector contracts, and create a more universal user experience, reducing the need for training when someone changes agencies.

5208,,189b953d-c375-481e-96dd-acc82053eba7,"As a state employee that has laterally transferred to different Departments, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the responsibilities and level of expectations for the AGPA classification. In one department, as a seasoned AGPA I was required to have every email reviewed that was being sent to an external source. Another department that I worked for places their AGPA staff in lead roles, facilitating and leading discussions with internal and external stakeholders and the management sit back and watch. These types of inconsistencies can cause people to struggle when they believe they are taking a lateral position but their level of responsibility dramatically increases in their new role, it affects efficiencies when AGPAs with multiple years of experience cannot effectively lateral into similarly positioned AGPA roles. 

I believe there needs to be statewide accountability put in place in order to make the level of responsibility across classifications consistent. This cannot simply be done by reviewing duty statements which are broad and do not often reflect the management culture of the office. There should be statewide reviews of internal procedures for varying classifications to ensure that state workers are paid for the same level of responsibility, effort, and commitment.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-29T22:28:55+0000,1,"[

This limitation not only slows down innovation but also prevents us from serving our communities with the efficiency, creativity, and responsiveness they deserve.  AI, when used ethically and intentionally, is not a threat—it’s a partner. It can help us streamline repetitive tasks, generate accessible content, analyze data for equity gaps, and even support inclusive language in public communications. These are not luxuries; they are necessities in a modern public service environment. To solve this, I would propose a pilot program that allows the use of AI tools within a secure, policy-guided framework. We could start with low-risk applications—like summarizing meeting notes, drafting outreach materials, or organizing project timelines—and build trust through transparency and training. My vision is not just to adopt technology, but to steward it wisely. With the right guardrails, AI can become a tool for justice, clarity, and care—reflecting the very heart of public service.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-18T20:23:04+0000,3,"[

Politicians pushing their objectives and the people making the rules and regulations have either never done the work or haven't done it in so long they do not understand the impact of the policies and procedures, or whether it will make sense to the end user applying the rule.

Maybe there should be more in person, role-based training with SME's to assist.

This includes the software used to input information, management approval process, and revision of forms that need to be resubmitted.  Expense reporting, including receipt submission should be done all electronically (rather than having a requirement to hard mail in forms that can get lost).  The process for expense report is not intuitive and expense reports often get rejected, resulting in additional staff to correct these forms and correspond with reviewers.  An updated program, even if one created by a vendor, should be used for this.  The systems used for time accounting is very outdated and clunky.  I have used much better time accounting systems in previous jobs, which require less time to complete and are easier to use.  State vehicle maintenance is a nightmare - there is no fleet maintenance program for our state vehicle - we are required to track maintenance ourselves.  Getting repairs done is difficult, even if the repair is urgent, requiring us get procurement approval for the repair and to use a very limited number of maintenance shops in our area.  In addition, we have to use multiple maintenance shops (one for tires, another for battery change out), which are typically about 20-40 miles away from our office and require staff to lose at least half a day to wait for these repairs.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-21T20:15:16+0000,0,"[

Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) 
My most significant contribution has been leading the redesign of our Federal Program Monitoring approach, moving from a compliance-focused audit model to a capacity-building partnership framework. Previously, the FPM process created significant anxiety among LEAs, with extensive document requests and adversarial site visits that consumed enormous staff time on both sides while providing limited educational value.
A key component of this transformation involved conducting a comprehensive review of existing FPM requirements to identify regulatory overreach. After systematically analyzing our monitoring protocols, several questionable requirements were brought to the legal team for review. This process resulted in the elimination of multiple requirements that exceeded our statutory authority and created unnecessary burden on districts without corresponding educational benefit.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-09-03T16:29:34+0000,0,"[

I often see representatives from various DCA entities at community resource fairs, senior fairs, etc. Outreach teams from different agencies are constantly searching for these events and trying to join them.

Why don’t we organize a DCA Consumer Protection Fair ourselves? As many DCA boards and bureaus as possible can join and set up a table/booth. Members of the public can attend and learn about all the resources available to help keep them safe, from how to find a trustworthy accountant to staying safe online, what to do if they were sold a bad car by a dealership, etc. A big issue facing us is that consumers simply don't know that our resources exist until we actively seek them out and inform them.

3904,,c5e11b00-e7e1-4333-beeb-3cdf0275e606,"Government workers are often drawn to state service because of the stability, flexibility, and the mission of public service. That’s why the return-to-office mandate worries me—it risks pushing people out and discouraging new talent from joining. I’ve already seen good colleagues leave or begin planning their exit, and we can’t afford to lose strong employees when recruitment is already so competitive.

At the same time, I do recognize that some employees don’t always engage or collaborate well when working remotely. That lack of participation can create frustration and fuel the push for mandates. But instead of a blanket requirement, I think we should treat remote collaboration and remote work etiquette as part of performance expectations. If someone is showing up, communicating well, and delivering results, they should keep the flexibility. If not, then their performance review could require them to be in the office more often.

This approach keeps flexibility as a competitive perk, while also addressing real concerns about accountability and teamwork. It sets a higher bar for engagement without punishing those who are already working effectively in remote or hybrid environments.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-08-19T19:35:58+0000,2,"[

5537,,a5a0fe4a-b64d-46b8-b931-0aac509de80f,"My experience as a state employee is that many managers—and the culture they shape—need a mindset upgrade. Gallup shows that office culture and morale flow from the top down, and morale is the foundation of productivity, engagement, efficiency, and retention.

Too often, I see managers:
-Blaming staff for failures while taking credit for successes.
-Struggling to delegate effectively, creating confusion and unclear expectations.
-Avoiding leadership when it’s most needed, leaving staff to fill the gap.
-Focusing on process over results, stifling creativity and growth.
-Failing to empathize with staff as individuals, imposing unrealistic standards.
-Resisting feedback, dismissing new ideas, or fearing innovation.
-Managing by fear, micromanagement, or “command and control” rather than trust and accountability.
-Prioritizing compliance and appearances over genuine outcomes.

The result is lower morale, weaker teams, and higher turnover. Spending the time to learn how to delegate wisely, listen actively, and lead with vision pays off with stronger, more productive teams. Far too many state resources are wasted replacing staff who leave managers—not jobs.

For inspiration, I recommend Simon Sinek’s leadership talks on YouTube.","Anything else? - Would you add any other ideas, including from your perspective as a California resident?",2025-09-24T20:43:52+0000,0,"[

Over time, new employees receive strong onboarding, but tenured staff may not always get the same opportunities for refreshers or updates on evolving policies, technology, and our mission. This can create uneven knowledge levels and inefficiencies in how we carry out our responsibilities.
To address this, I would advocate for a structured internal training program that includes regular refresher sessions focused on our core duties, our mission, and the ‘why’ behind our work. This would help reinforce a shared sense of purpose and accountability.
Another problem I would address is the overlap and redundancy that can occur between agencies or divisions within our department. While each unit has an important role, sometimes our responsibilities intersect in ways that create duplicated efforts, confusion over jurisdiction, or inefficiencies in communication and data sharing.
Additionally, I would look at streamlining redundant paperwork and leveraging technology to make our processes more efficient — for example, consolidating overlapping forms into a single digital system or using data-sharing tools between departments.

Everyday Californians struggle to participate meaningfully in this process and many simply give up. Meanwhile, agency staff- stretched thing and bound by unclear, outdate (some Basin Plans) - often seem unable or unwilling to help.  The system is not just slow it is inequitable. There are major structual issues driving the dysfunction: fragmented authority, a legal inablity to rely on sister agency reviews, and a risk-blind permitting process ( small projects get similar requirements to big projects). 

These isuess can't be solved overnight but having a way to measurer the effects and inequities would be a start. There could be a few steps to start: 
-Create share reivew systems across agenices so they can work together instead of having separate sources of data on permits. Identify repeated work across agencies. 
- Change/update laws to let agencies rely on high quality review done by partner agencies.
- Build tiered permittig process that matches level of review to actual risk of the project ( driveway, replacement of infrastructure without increased foot print), versus new industrial center).

Leadership Culture
The traditional chain of command may suit high-risk environments, but in civil service, it often stifles collaboration and trust. Leadership based solely on tenure can lead to silos, disengagement, and missed opportunities for innovation. Incorporating 360-degree peer reviews and influence-based leadership models would promote accountability, humility, and a culture of shared success.

Classification System
Our current classification structure, designed for factory-style work, doesn’t reflect the dynamic, cross-functional nature of today’s roles. It limits mobility, professional growth, and alignment with modern competency-based hiring practices. A shift toward a flexible, skills-based framework would better support recruitment, retention, and continuous improvement.

Technology Barriers
Outdated systems discourage younger, tech-savvy professionals from joining the State. Investing in modern, user-friendly tools is essential to attracting talent and signaling that innovation is a priority.

Naturally, this would lead to how to progress from AGSA, to SSMI; from SSMI to SSMII; etc. the training, courses, education, recommended reading.
Another example, how to progress from Office Technician, to Business Services, etc.
The classification roadmaps could include the Departments that have the specific classifications and recommendations for “assignments” as part of your career path, i.e., a new to the state employee may want to start at a smaller department, then progress as an AGPA to a medium department. 
Granted this would be a massive undertaking and a classification duty statement can vary greatly based off the agency and its mission, however, I think it could be beneficial to provide that general path as some employees may lack the mentorship from their current department or supervisors or generally not know how to create a path to career within the state.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-26T17:46:26+0000,0,"[

Every department could hire more staff to do work for the people if they weren’t paying so much for unnecessary business leases.
Additionally, forcing employees to return to office has reduced morale because employees have less money and time to spend with their families, leading to less positive customer service experiences for the public. 

If the people delivering the service are miserable, they aren’t going out of their way to make that experience positive for the public.

Even when CEQA has been waived—such as the 45-day priority projects or the 2025 Secretary’s suspension—we still must comply with all other environmental laws. That often results in more paperwork and delays than if we had simply gone through CEQA. For example, CDFW frequently requires a take permit, which adds 90+ days to a project, making timely fuel reduction even harder.

A more effective solution would be to create a 4(d) rule under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), modeled after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s approach under the federal ESA. These rules allow targeted exemptions or modifications to take prohibitions for threatened species, so beneficial projects like fuel reduction can move forward without lengthy permitting when impacts are minimal or positive. This is especially critical for California’s fire-adapted species, which often benefit from vegetation treatments.

Currently, CDFW offers Memoranda of Understanding for take, but these are case-by-case, drafted after listing, and far less efficient. A 4(d) rule would instead be established at the time of listing by the Fish and Game Commission, ensuring consistency and streamlining the process.

5924,,679a4c6c-f071-4acc-acb2-34c640db70ee,"As a California state employee, I’ve focused on making data processes and services more effective and efficient for both staff and the public. One example is my work on modernizing DMV’s data pipelines and integrations during our transition from legacy mainframe systems to Salesforce. I led efforts to clean, map, and validate large datasets into standardized formats. By automating parts of the validation and transformation process in SQL and Python, I reduced manual review time from days to hours and improved data accuracy before migration.

Another improvement involved documenting and streamlining the change request and deployment workflow for the DVM environment. Previously, approvals and scheduling caused delays due to unclear communication between teams. I restructured the process with clear ownership tracking, ensuring deployment jobs were pre-approved and ready for execution without back-and-forth emails. 

I always try to improve collaboration across teams. For example, I created shared dashboards and data dictionaries that made it easier for both DMV and vendor analysts to trace field mappings and data lineage, cutting rework and confusion across multiple projects.",Share what has been working - Examples,2025-10-08T00:55:55+0000,0,"[

5223,,44e69a2e-3014-4f82-aac4-0ca3510f1cd7,"California's state agencies often have different interpretations of the same policies set by entities like CalHR, the Secretary of State, and DGS. This decentralized approach creates a lack of uniformity in business processes across departments, particularly in areas like Human Resources.

A recent project aimed to identify a ""golden image""—a consistent, shared process—for the departments within our agency. However, we discovered that each department follows a different process for the same core functions. This forced us to develop a separate, customized IT system (SaaS) for one department and then hire a consultant to modify the code to fit the next department's unique needs. This constant customization is expensive, with each new system integration costing between $250,000 and $500,000.

By mandating a single, consistent interpretation of state policies, we could achieve significant efficiencies and save millions of dollars. A standardized approach would allow for easier cross-training of staff and eliminate the need for costly, department-specific customizations of IT systems. It would ensure that technology solutions developed for one department are readily usable by others, creating a more cohesive and cost-effective operational model for the state.

Furthermore, it may be beneficial to centralize human resources at the agency level and have one  HR system across the whole agency to save even more money.  This centralized idea can work for other admin areas as well.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-09-02T16:27:20+0000,1,"[

Implementing statewide telework reduces overhead costs like office space, utilities, and operational expenses—freeing funds for critical public services.

Studies show telework often increases productivity due to fewer distractions and more flexible schedules. This flexibility supports better work-life balance, reducing burnout and turnover—key challenges for the State workforce.

Telework also expands the talent pool by attracting skilled workers regardless of location, which is vital for hard-to-fill positions. It enhances inclusivity by making State jobs accessible to people with disabilities and those in rural or underserved areas.

Additionally, statewide telework adoption demonstrates environmental responsibility by cutting carbon emissions from commuting. Less commuter traffic means public savings through reduced wear on roads and lower maintenance costs. Telework ensures government continuity during emergencies—like natural disasters or health crises—making services more resilient. Overall, telework strengthens institutional performance and public service delivery.",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-08-28T18:34:53+0000,0,"[

The appointment of people with little to no direct experience in the work of an agency results in these CEAs hiring teams of consultants to advise them on what actions to take, which bill at rates of $400-$600/hour ($800,000 to $1.2mm FTE salary).  Then these political appointees hire people that they know who also are not experts in government or the agency's business and use consultants to teach them how to run the business.  Then, anyone with actual knowledge of the agency's business leaves because they're not valued and they see the waste all around them.  They know that they would make more money as a consultant instead or have less frustration working for an ignorant boss and being a punching bag for the general public who don't value the work of government either. 

Many state employees are just contract managers and have little or no private sector experience.  The state needs to be serious about paying people what they are worth so they can attract real experts to run departments and to eliminate the system of appointments that destroys expertise.

Executive Memorandum
To: Fire Chief Brian Marshal-CALOES-Fire Rescue
From: Dave Norman, Assistant Chief-CALOES-Special Operations-US&R
Date: October 12, 2025
Subject: Request for CAL-Card Issuance to Special Operations Assistant Chiefs
Purpose:
This memorandum requests the issuance of CAL-Cards to CAL-OES Special Operations Assistant Chiefs to support operational effectiveness during emergency deployments and pre-positioning of specialized response teams.
Background:
Special Operations Assistant Chiefs serve as Agency Representatives (A-REPs) during high-impact emergency operations and pre-positioning missions involving:
•	Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Teams
•	Swiftwater Rescue Teams
•	Regional Urban Search & Rescue (US&R) Task Forces
•	FEMA US&R State Teams deployed in-state or out-of-state via EMAC
These deployments require rapid, on-the-ground decision-making and logistical coordination. Currently, the absence of direct purchasing authority via CAL-Cards limits the ability of Assistant Chiefs to procure essential resources, services, and supplies in real time—impacting mission agility and service delivery. The CAL-Card can be used for unexpected costs that arise, and that the assigned IMT might not be familiar with, such as the N95 mask needs for US&R Personnel during the Wide Area Search Operations at the January Brush Fires.
Currently several agencies provide CAL-Cards to their supervisors, in some cases to Company Office",Share your idea - Primary problem and ideas to solve the problem,2025-10-17T18:23:15+0000,0,"[
