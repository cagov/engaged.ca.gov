      This model shapes the solutions data to make it easier to select "top solutions" from the E3 dataset.
      First, it takes the extracted solution statements that have previously been output, and uses AI to expand the list
      with shorter, more specific solution statements. Next, it takes the subtheme/main theme map and labels
      each shortened solution statement with one or more subthemes (and their accompanying main themes).
      The final output is a list of solution statement theme/subtheme assignments.
    columns:
      - name: SOLUTION_ID
        description: Unique id for each solution statement, comment_ID, and solution sequence combined, not enforced
      - name: SOLUTION_COMMENT_ID
        description: comment_id where the solution was identified
      - name: REPLY_TO_ID
        description: Identifier of the comment this is a reply to. NULL for top-level comments
      - name: SOURCE_COMMENT
        description: The original comment text from which the solution was extracted
      - name: SOLUTION_SEQUENCE
        description: Sequence number of the solution within its source comment
